funding for this program is provided by

00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:10,730
additional funding provided by

3
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:32,400
today we turn to Kant's reply to

4
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:39,739
Aristotle Kant thinks that Aristotle

5
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:45,449
just made a mistake it's one thing Kant

6
00:00:45,449 --> 00:00:48,870
says to support a fair framework of

7
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,960
Rights within which people can pursue

8
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,519
their own conceptions of the good life

9
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:59,730
it's something else and something that

10
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:03,150
runs the risk of coercion to base law or

11
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:06,229
principles of justice on any particular

12
00:01:06,229 --> 00:01:08,640
conception of the good life

13
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,979
you remember Aristotle says in order to

14
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:12,810
investigate the ideal Constitution we

15
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:14,610
have first to figure out the best way to

16
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:15,590
live

17
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:19,320
Kant would reject that idea he says that

18
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,240
constitutions and laws and rights should

19
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,939
not embody or affirm or promote any

20
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:27,750
particular way of life that's at odds

21
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,560
with freedom for Aristotle the whole

22
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,200
point of law the purpose of the polis is

23
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,899
to shape character to cultivate the

24
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:42,719
virtue of citizens to inculcate Civic

25
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:44,729
excellence to make possible a good way

26
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:46,710
of life that's what he tells us in the

27
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,899
politics for Kant on the other hand the

28
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:53,939
purpose of law the point of a

29
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:57,210
constitution is not to inculcate or to

30
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:02,009
promote virtue its to set up a fair

31
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:05,119
framework of Rights within which

32
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,740
citizens may be free to pursue their own

33
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,580
conceptions of the good for themselves

34
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,800
so we see the difference in their

35
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,010
theories of justice we see the

36
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:20,130
difference in their account of law or

37
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:22,290
the role of a constitution the point of

38
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:25,080
politics and underlying these

39
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,330
differences are two different accounts

40
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:31,680
of what it means to be a free person for

41
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:37,560
Aristotle we're free insofar as we have

42
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,160
the capacity to realize our potential

43
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:46,170
that leads us to the question of fit fit

44
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:48,270
between persons and the roles that are

45
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:50,550
appropriate to them figuring out what

46
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:53,970
I'm cut out for that's what it means to

47
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:56,040
lead a free life to live up to my

48
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:01,080
potential Kant rejects that idea and

49
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,050
instead substitutes his famously

50
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,630
demanding notion of freedom as the

51
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:10,140
capacity to act autonomously freedom

52
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:13,050
means acting according to a law I give

53
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:17,460
myself freedom as autonomy part of the

54
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:22,250
the appeal part of the moral force of

55
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:25,640
the view of content of Rawls

56
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:30,090
consists in the conception of the person

57
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:35,190
as a free and independent self capable

58
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:42,270
of choosing his or her own ends the

59
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,710
image of the self is free and

60
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:47,910
independent offers up if you think about

61
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,400
it a powerful liberating vision because

62
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,490
what it says is that as free moral

63
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:59,000
persons we are not bound by any ties of

64
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,390
history or of tradition or of inherited

65
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:06,360
status that we haven't chosen for

66
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:11,730
ourselves and so we're unbound by any

67
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:14,670
moral ties prior to our choosing them

68
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:23,090
and that means that means that we are

69
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:26,880
free and independent sovereign selves

70
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,320
we're the authors of the only

71
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:35,430
obligations that constrain us the

72
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:39,690
communitarian critics of Kantian and

73
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:42,900
Rawls in liberalism acknowledge that

74
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,910
there is something powerful and

75
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,480
inspiring in that account of freedom

76
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:51,180
free independent choosing self but they

77
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:54,770
argue it misses something

78
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:58,020
it misses a whole dimension of moral

79
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:01,409
life and even political life it can't

80
00:05:01,409 --> 00:05:02,580
make sense of our moral experience

81
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:06,000
because it can't account for certain

82
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,599
moral and political obligations that we

83
00:05:09,599 --> 00:05:12,289
commonly recognize and even prize and

84
00:05:12,289 --> 00:05:14,659
these include obligations of membership

85
00:05:14,659 --> 00:05:18,840
loyalty solidarity and other moral ties

86
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,389
that may claim us for reasons that we

87
00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:25,220
can't trace to an act of consent

88
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:35,250
alasdair macintyre gives an account but

89
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,740
he calls a narrative conception of the

90
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,409
cell it's a different account of the

91
00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:46,580
self human beings are essentially

92
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,949
storytelling creatures MacIntyre argues

93
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:53,190
that means I can only answer the

94
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:56,340
question what am i to do if I can answer

95
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,860
the prior question of what story or

96
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:03,180
stories do I find myself apart that's

97
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,889
what he means by the narrative

98
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:08,279
conception of the self what does this

99
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:11,550
have to do with the idea of community in

100
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:17,039
belonging MacIntyre says this once you

101
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,650
accept this narrative aspect of moral

102
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:24,240
reflection you will notice that we can

103
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,629
never seek for the good or exercise the

104
00:06:27,629 --> 00:06:31,319
virtues only as individuals we all

105
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:33,930
approach our circumstance as bearers of

106
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:36,690
particular social identities

107
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:40,979
I am someone's son or daughter a citizen

108
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:43,379
of this or that city I belong to this

109
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:45,779
plan that tried this nation

110
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:48,990
hence MacIntyre argues what is good for

111
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:52,050
me has to be the good for someone who

112
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:56,129
inhabits these roles I inherit from the

113
00:06:56,129 --> 00:06:58,889
past of my family my city my tribe my

114
00:06:58,889 --> 00:07:02,479
nation a variety of debts inheritances

115
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,310
expectations and obligations these

116
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:08,490
constitute the given of my life my

117
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:11,190
morale starting point this is in part

118
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:14,660
what gives my life its moral

119
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:17,880
particularity that's the narrative

120
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:24,180
conception of the self and it's a

121
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,400
conception that sees the self as claimed

122
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,680
or encumbered at least to some extent by

123
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,970
the history the tradition the

124
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:39,599
communities of which it's a part we

125
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,150
can't make sense of our lives not only

126
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,949
is a psychological matter but also as a

127
00:07:43,949 --> 00:07:45,690
moral matter in thinking what we ought

128
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:48,810
to do without attending to these

129
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:53,009
features about us now MacIntyre

130
00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:55,500
recognizes that this narrative account

131
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:00,630
this picture of the encumbered self puts

132
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:04,500
his account at odds with contemporary

133
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,520
liberalism and individualism from the

134
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,509
standpoint of individualism I am what I

135
00:08:12,509 --> 00:08:14,490
myself choose to be

136
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,979
I'm a biologically be my father's son

137
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:19,080
but I can't be held responsible for what

138
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,889
he did unless I choose to assume such

139
00:08:22,889 --> 00:08:26,430
responsibility I can't be held

140
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:28,650
responsible for what my country does or

141
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:32,099
has done unless I choose to assume such

142
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:35,820
responsibility but MacIntyre says this

143
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,309
reflects a certain kind of moral

144
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:42,570
shallowness even blindness it's a

145
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:44,399
blindness at odds with the full measure

146
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,649
of responsibility which sometimes he

147
00:08:46,649 --> 00:08:49,670
says involves collective responsibility

148
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:52,320
or responsibilities that may float from

149
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,170
historic memories and he gives some

150
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:57,690
examples such individualism it's

151
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:59,579
expressed by those contemporary

152
00:08:59,579 --> 00:09:02,850
Americans who deny any responsibility

153
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:05,070
for the effects of slavery upon black

154
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:07,350
Americans saying I never owned any

155
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:11,550
slaves or the young German who believes

156
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:16,110
that having been born after 1945 means

157
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:18,930
that what Nazis did to Jews has no moral

158
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:21,279
relevance to his relationship

159
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:26,709
to his Jewish contemporaries McIntyre

160
00:09:26,709 --> 00:09:29,550
says all of these attitudes of

161
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:33,160
historical amnesia amount to a kind of

162
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:38,470
moral abdication once you see that who

163
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:42,459
we are and what it means to sort out our

164
00:09:42,459 --> 00:09:45,910
obligations can't be separated shouldn't

165
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:49,170
be separated from the life histories

166
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:51,449
that define us

167
00:09:51,449 --> 00:09:54,370
the contrast he says when the narrative

168
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:57,129
account is clear for the story of my

169
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:59,589
life is always embedded in the story of

170
00:09:59,589 --> 00:10:01,300
those communities from which I derived

171
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,059
my identity I am born with the past and

172
00:10:04,059 --> 00:10:06,160
to try to cut myself off from that past

173
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:12,069
is to deform my present relationships so

174
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:14,410
there you have in McIntyre a strong

175
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:18,249
statement of the idea that the self

176
00:10:18,249 --> 00:10:20,800
can't be detached shouldn't be detached

177
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,589
from its particular ties of membership

178
00:10:25,589 --> 00:10:31,870
history story narrative now I want to

179
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:36,100
get your reactions to the communitarian

180
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:40,360
critique of the individualist or the

181
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,839
voluntarist the unencumbered self but

182
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,360
let's make it concrete so that you can

183
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,959
react to more than just the theory of it

184
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:53,259
by looking at the two different accounts

185
00:10:53,259 --> 00:10:55,269
of moral and political obligation that

186
00:10:55,269 --> 00:10:57,490
arise depending on which of these

187
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:04,089
conceptions of the person one accepts on

188
00:11:04,089 --> 00:11:07,540
the liberal conception moral and

189
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:10,269
political obligations arise in one of

190
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:14,679
two ways there are natural duties that

191
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:17,529
we owe human beings as such duties of

192
00:11:17,529 --> 00:11:20,559
respect for persons Quay persons these

193
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:23,370
obligations are universal

194
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:28,259
then as Rawls points out there are also

195
00:11:28,259 --> 00:11:31,509
voluntary obligations obligations that

196
00:11:31,509 --> 00:11:34,050
we owe to particular others

197
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:39,040
insofar as we have agreed whether

198
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,820
through a promise or a deal or a

199
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:46,630
contract now the issue between the

200
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:49,029
liberal and communitarian accounts of

201
00:11:49,029 --> 00:11:53,850
the self is there another category of

202
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:58,990
obligation or not the communitarian says

203
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:01,779
there is there is a third category that

204
00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:03,190
might be called obligations of

205
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:06,579
solidarity or loyalty or membership the

206
00:12:06,579 --> 00:12:10,240
communitarian argues that construing all

207
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,490
obligations as either natural duties or

208
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:18,220
voluntary obligations fails to capture

209
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:21,810
obligations of membership or solidarity

210
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:24,279
loyalties whose moral force consists

211
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:27,100
partly in the fact that living by them

212
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,889
is inseparable from understanding

213
00:12:29,889 --> 00:12:32,260
ourselves as the particular persons we

214
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:36,310
are what would be some examples and then

215
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:38,470
I want to see how you would react to

216
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:43,990
them examples of obligations of

217
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:49,089
membership that are particular but don't

218
00:12:49,089 --> 00:12:51,100
necessarily flowed from consent but

219
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:55,079
rather from membership narrative

220
00:12:55,079 --> 00:13:00,699
community one situation the most common

221
00:13:00,699 --> 00:13:03,449
examples are ones to do with the family

222
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,740
the relation between parents and

223
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:11,380
children for example suppose there were

224
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:15,910
two children drowning you could save

225
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:18,670
only one of them one was your child the

226
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:22,750
other was a stranger's child would you

227
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,620
have an obligation to flip a coin or

228
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:29,829
would there be something morally obtuse

229
00:13:29,829 --> 00:13:32,310
if you didn't rush to save your child

230
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:34,899
now you may say well parents have agreed

231
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:38,560
to have their children so take the other

232
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,010
case the case of children's obligation

233
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:43,660
for their parents now we don't choose

234
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:46,720
our parents we don't even choose to have

235
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,450
parents

236
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:50,620
there is that asymmetry and yet

237
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:55,040
considered two aging parents one of them

238
00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:00,290
yours the other strangers doesn't it

239
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:01,910
make moral sense to think that you have

240
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:04,130
a greater obligation to look after your

241
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:07,730
aged parent then to flip a coin or to

242
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:12,050
help the strangers now is this traceable

243
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:16,880
to consent not likely or take a couple

244
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,560
of political examples during World War

245
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:26,420
two French Resistance pilots flew

246
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:29,839
bombing raids over occupied France one

247
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:33,079
day one of the pilots received his

248
00:14:33,079 --> 00:14:37,010
targets and noticed that the village he

249
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:40,250
was being asked to bomb was his home

250
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:45,440
village he refused not disputing that it

251
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,200
was as necessary as the target he bombed

252
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,899
yesterday he refused on the ground that

253
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:52,430
he couldn't bring himself it would be a

254
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:56,390
special moral crime for him to bomb his

255
00:14:56,390 --> 00:15:01,279
people even in a cause that he supported

256
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:05,959
the cause of liberating France now do we

257
00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:09,500
admire that if we do the communitarian

258
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:13,000
argues it's because we do recognize

259
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,329
obligations of solidarity take another

260
00:15:17,329 --> 00:15:19,850
example some years ago there was a

261
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:23,839
famine in Ethiopia hundreds of thousands

262
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,020
of people were starving the Israeli

263
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,750
government organized an airlift to

264
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,990
rescue Ethiopian Jews they didn't have

265
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:34,790
the capacity to rescue everyone in

266
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:39,160
Ethiopia they rescued several hundred

267
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,829
Ethiopian Jews now what's your moral

268
00:15:42,829 --> 00:15:46,910
assessment is that a kind of morally

269
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:51,100
troubling partiality a kind of prejudice

270
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:57,020
or as the Israeli government thought is

271
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:00,580
there a special obligation of solidarity

272
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:03,760
that this airlift properly

273
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:07,970
responded to well that takes us to the

274
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:09,920
broader question of patriotism

275
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,400
what morally speaking is to be said for

276
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:17,600
patriotism there are two towns named

277
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,790
Franklin one is Franklin Texas and the

278
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,260
other is just across the Rio Grande

279
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:24,920
River Franklin Mexico what is the moral

280
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:28,130
significance of national boundaries why

281
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:32,480
is it or is it the case that we as

282
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,090
Americans have a greater responsibility

283
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:36,500
for the health and the education in the

284
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,930
welfare and public provision for people

285
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:42,830
who live in Franklin Texas then equally

286
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:45,550
needy people just across the river

287
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:49,880
living in Franklin Mexico according to

288
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,130
the communitarian account membership

289
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:53,480
does matter

290
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:58,400
and the reason patriotism is at least

291
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,830
potentially a virtue is that it is an

292
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:04,750
expression of the obligations of

293
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:09,890
citizenship how many are sympathetic to

294
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:12,349
the idea that there is this third

295
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:15,920
category of obligation the obligation

296
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,030
obligations of solidarity or membership

297
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:23,109
how many are sympathetic to that idea

298
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:26,750
and how many are critical of that idea

299
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:30,620
how many think all obligations can be

300
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:35,660
accounted for in the first two ways all

301
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,370
right let's hear from the critics of the

302
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:44,180
communitarian idea first yes my biggest

303
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,400
concern with the idea of having

304
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,410
obligations because you're a member of

305
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:51,080
something or because of solidarity is

306
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:54,170
that it seems that if you accept those

307
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:56,240
obligations as being sort of morally

308
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,640
binding then there's a greater

309
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,730
occurrence of overlapping obligations a

310
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:04,280
greater occurrence of good versus good

311
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:08,240
and I don't know if this sort of

312
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,130
framework allows us to choose between

313
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:10,640
them

314
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,950
good in much your name

315
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:18,190
so you worried that if we recognize

316
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:21,340
obligations of membership or solidarity

317
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:24,110
since we inhabit different communities

318
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:26,840
their claims might conflict and what

319
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,210
would we do if we have competing

320
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:35,019
obligations yes

321
00:18:35,019 --> 00:18:38,509
well one solution is that we could view

322
00:18:38,509 --> 00:18:42,649
ourselves as ultimately members of the

323
00:18:42,649 --> 00:18:45,830
human community and that then within

324
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,690
that we have all these smaller spheres

325
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:50,659
of that you know I am an American or I

326
00:18:50,659 --> 00:18:55,789
am a student at Harvard and so the most

327
00:18:55,789 --> 00:18:59,090
important community to be to be

328
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:03,259
obligated to is the community of human

329
00:19:03,259 --> 00:19:06,110
beings and then from there you can sort

330
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:08,509
of evaluate which other ones are most

331
00:19:08,509 --> 00:19:11,330
important to you so the most univer and

332
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:12,019
what's your name

333
00:19:12,019 --> 00:19:15,070
Nikola so Nikola you say the most

334
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,629
universal community we inhabit the

335
00:19:17,629 --> 00:19:20,029
community of humankind always takes

336
00:19:20,029 --> 00:19:24,249
precedence yes Patrick are you satisfied

337
00:19:24,249 --> 00:19:26,139
No

338
00:19:26,139 --> 00:19:29,240
why not um it seems rather arbitrary

339
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,820
that we should choose the universal

340
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:34,399
obligation over the more specific

341
00:19:34,399 --> 00:19:37,070
obligation I might also say that I

342
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:39,860
should be obligated first to the most

343
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,509
specific of my obligations for instance

344
00:19:41,509 --> 00:19:43,999
take my family as a small unit of

345
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:46,159
solidarity perhaps I should be first

346
00:19:46,159 --> 00:19:49,580
obligated to that unit and then perhaps

347
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,919
to the unit of my town and then my

348
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,869
country and then the human race good

349
00:19:53,869 --> 00:19:54,860
thank you

350
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,919
let's I want to hear from another critic

351
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,679
of the communitarian view we have the

352
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:04,700
objection well what if Goods collide who

353
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,009
objects to the whole idea of it who sees

354
00:20:07,009 --> 00:20:09,470
patriotism is just a kind of prejudice

355
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:16,059
that ideally we should overcome yes

356
00:20:16,059 --> 00:20:18,950
patriotism reflects a community

357
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:22,700
membership that's a like a given I think

358
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,960
the problem is that

359
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,740
whereas some memberships are natural

360
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:35,380
narratives the narrative of citizenship

361
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,929
is a constructed one and I think a false

362
00:20:37,929 --> 00:20:41,860
one because as the river is just a

363
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:44,200
historical accident it makes no sense

364
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,150
that because the lottery of birth threw

365
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:48,360
me into the United States as opposed to

366
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,130
Mexico that that's the membership that I

367
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:52,929
should be a part of good and what's your

368
00:20:52,929 --> 00:20:53,320
name

369
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:58,780
Elizabeth Elizabeth who has a reply yes

370
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:02,410
I think in in general uh we have to ask

371
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:03,940
where do our moral obligations arise

372
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:06,580
from anyway and I think basically

373
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,950
there'd be two places from which they

374
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:11,049
could arise one would be kin another one

375
00:21:11,049 --> 00:21:13,900
would be reciprocity and isn't the

376
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,580
closer you are associated to other

377
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,049
people there's a natural reciprocity

378
00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:21,070
there in terms of having interactions

379
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:24,730
with those people you interact the

380
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:26,230
neighbors on your street with the other

381
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:27,760
people in your country through economic

382
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,380
arrangement I don't know and you don't

383
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:32,020
know those people in Franklin Texas any

384
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,490
more than you know the people in

385
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:36,250
Franklin Mexico do you presumably you're

386
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,960
naturally more connected with the people

387
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,880
in your own country in terms of

388
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,559
interaction and trade than you are with

389
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:44,020
people in other countries good

390
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:47,530
who else I'll go ahead yeah I think that

391
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:51,160
a lot of the basis for a patriotism can

392
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,870
be compared to like school spirit or

393
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:55,480
even house fear that we see here where

394
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,490
freshmen are sorted into houses and then

395
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:59,290
within a day they have developed some

396
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:01,780
sort of attachment or a pride associated

397
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,669
with that house and so I think that we

398
00:22:03,669 --> 00:22:05,500
can probably draw a distinction between

399
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,410
a moral obligation for communitarian

400
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:11,020
beliefs and sort of just a sentimental

401
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:13,210
emotional attachment good way to say you

402
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:14,470
stay there what's your name

403
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:18,250
Rina what about go back to my example

404
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:20,260
about the obligation of the childhood

405
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,700
the parent would you say the same thing

406
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,040
there it's just a maybe or may not be a

407
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,990
sentimental toy but it has no moral

408
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:28,720
weight well I mean I'm not entirely

409
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,179
certain that accident

410
00:22:31,179 --> 00:22:33,940
in the initial stage is something that

411
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,650
will preclude like moral obligations

412
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:36,820
later

413
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:40,179
and so you know just because we were

414
00:22:40,179 --> 00:22:41,649
randomly sorted into a house or just

415
00:22:41,649 --> 00:22:43,630
because we don't choose who our parents

416
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,940
are what country born into doesn't

417
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:48,370
necessarily mean that we won't like

418
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:51,159
develop an obligation based on some type

419
00:22:51,159 --> 00:22:54,429
of benefit I guess just sort of see your

420
00:22:54,429 --> 00:22:58,480
obligation to your parent that's greater

421
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,350
than two agent parents around the world

422
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:07,509
is only because and insofar as you're

423
00:23:07,509 --> 00:23:10,539
repaying a benefit that your parent gave

424
00:23:10,539 --> 00:23:12,700
you when you were growing up yeah I mean

425
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,889
I would say that if you look at cases of

426
00:23:14,889 --> 00:23:17,080
adoption where you know you have a

427
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,519
biological parent somewhere else that

428
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:20,289
you don't interact with and then you

429
00:23:20,289 --> 00:23:21,940
have a parent you know who adopted you

430
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:24,669
most people would say that if you had to

431
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:26,440
pick between them in the case of you

432
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,139
know aging parents that your obligation

433
00:23:29,139 --> 00:23:31,570
would lie more with the person who

434
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:33,909
raised you and who had exchanges with

435
00:23:33,909 --> 00:23:35,830
you meaningfully may ask you one more

436
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:38,200
question about the parent sure do you

437
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,059
think that a person with a bad parent

438
00:23:40,059 --> 00:23:44,649
owes them less I don't know because I've

439
00:23:44,649 --> 00:23:53,289
never had a bad parent I think that's a

440
00:23:53,289 --> 00:23:54,909
good place to end thank you we'll

441
00:23:54,909 --> 00:23:58,860
continue with this next time thank you

442
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:04,360
if I were working on an egg problem set

443
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,610
for example and I saw that my roommate

444
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:09,549
was cheating that might be a bad thing

445
00:24:09,549 --> 00:24:11,530
for hoot for him to do but I wouldn't

446
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:13,720
turn him in you would not turn him in I

447
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,160
wouldn't turn him in and I think that I

448
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,780
would argue that's the right thing to do

449
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:19,419
because of my obligation um you know you

450
00:24:19,419 --> 00:24:21,610
don't have a duty to tell the truth to

451
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:28,059
report someone who cheated today I'd

452
00:24:28,059 --> 00:24:31,480
like to take I'd like to consider the

453
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,150
strongest objections to the idea that

454
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:36,460
there are obligations of solidarity or

455
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:39,070
membership then I want to see if those

456
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:43,539
objections can be met successfully one

457
00:24:43,539 --> 00:24:45,580
objection emerged in the discussion last

458
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:51,190
time Patrick said well if obligations

459
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:53,710
flow from community membership and

460
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:56,320
identity we inhabit multiple communities

461
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,710
doesn't that mean that our obligations

462
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:04,330
will sometimes conflict so that's one

463
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:10,169
possible objection and then Rina said

464
00:25:10,169 --> 00:25:13,780
these examples meant to bring out the

465
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:19,860
moral force of solidarity and membership

466
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:23,220
examples about parents and children

467
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,720
about the French resistance fighter

468
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,179
asked to bomb his own village in drawing

469
00:25:28,179 --> 00:25:32,919
back about the airlift by Israel of

470
00:25:32,919 --> 00:25:35,169
Ethiopian Jews these examples they may

471
00:25:35,169 --> 00:25:37,870
be intuitively evocative Rina said but

472
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:40,150
really they're pointing to matters of

473
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:44,020
emotion matters of sentiment not true

474
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:49,299
moral obligations and then there were a

475
00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:53,830
number of objections not necessarily to

476
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:58,230
patriotism as such but to patriotism

477
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:02,309
understood as an obligation of

478
00:26:02,309 --> 00:26:07,860
solidarity and membership beyond consent

479
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:11,950
this objection

480
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:14,980
allowed that there can be obligations to

481
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:17,550
the communities we inhabit including

482
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:20,440
obligations of patriotism but this

483
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:24,190
objection argued that all of the

484
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:26,320
obligations of patriotism or of

485
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,830
community or membership are actually

486
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:33,280
based on liberal ideas and perfectly

487
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:36,760
compatible with them consent either

488
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:41,310
implicit or explicit or reciprocity

489
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:45,030
Julia rod how for example on the website

490
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:47,740
said that liberalism can endorse

491
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:51,880
patriotism as a voluntary moral

492
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,990
obligation patriotism and familial love

493
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:58,450
both fall under this category because

494
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,210
after all Julia points out the content

495
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:03,820
framework allows people free rein to

496
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:06,550
choose to express virtues such as these

497
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:11,590
if they want to so you don't need the

498
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:14,770
idea of a non-voluntary particular moral

499
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:18,010
obligation to capture the moral force of

500
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:24,430
community values where's Julia okay so

501
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:27,940
did I summarize that that fairly there

502
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,890
is action Julia actually is in line with

503
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:34,830
what Rawls says about this very topic

504
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:37,540
you weren't aware of that you came up

505
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:40,710
with it on your own that's pretty good

506
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:43,300
Rawls says when he's discussing

507
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:46,000
political obligation he says it's one

508
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,780
thing if someone runs for office or

509
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:51,490
enlist in the military they're making a

510
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:53,950
voluntary choice but Rawls says there is

511
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:56,200
I believe no political obligation

512
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,880
strictly speaking for citizens generally

513
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,930
because it's not clear what is the

514
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,240
requisite binding action and who has

515
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:09,280
performed it so Rawls acknowledges that

516
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:12,190
for ordinary citizens there is no

517
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:18,150
political obligation except insofar as

518
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:21,310
some particular citizen willingly

519
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:25,310
through an act of consent undertakes

520
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:27,590
or chooses such an obligation that's in

521
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:30,830
line with Julia's point it's related to

522
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:33,530
another objection that people have

523
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:37,940
raised which is it's perfectly possible

524
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:40,790
to recognize particular obligations to

525
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:44,530
one's family or to ins country provided

526
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:46,850
honoring those obligations doesn't

527
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,740
require you to violate any of the

528
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:52,730
natural duties or requirements of

529
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:54,830
Universal respect for persons quite

530
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:56,690
persons so that's consistent with the

531
00:28:56,690 --> 00:29:01,520
idea that we can choose if we want to to

532
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,380
express a loyalty to our country or to

533
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:05,870
our people or to our family provided we

534
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:09,290
don't do any injustice within the

535
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:11,270
framework acknowledging the priority

536
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:15,830
that is of the universal duties the one

537
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:17,870
objection that I didn't mention is the

538
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:20,630
view of those who say that obligations

539
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:22,340
of membership really are a kind of

540
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:24,800
collective selfishness why should we

541
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,650
honor them isn't it just a kind of

542
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:30,800
prejudice so what I'd like to do

543
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:34,120
perhaps if those of you who have agreed

544
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:37,010
who wrote and who have agreed to defect

545
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:40,460
to press these objections perhaps if you

546
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:43,010
could gather down all together will form

547
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:45,970
a team as we did once before and we'll

548
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:48,890
see if you can respond to those who want

549
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:52,750
to defend patriotism conceived as a

550
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:58,820
communal obligation now there were a

551
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:03,830
number of people who argued in defense

552
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:09,860
of patriotism as the communitarian view

553
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,930
conceives it so let me go down now and

554
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:15,650
join the critics the critics of

555
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:18,590
communitarianism if there's a microphone

556
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:20,810
that we could use somewhere okay thanks

557
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:26,570
Kate who as the critics of patriotism

558
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:29,330
communal patriotism gather their forces

559
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:33,740
here Patrick if you want to you can join

560
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:36,290
as well arena and others who have spoken

561
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:38,090
or addressed this question are free to

562
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:38,840
join in

563
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,360
but I would like to hear now from those

564
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:45,200
of you who defend patriotism and defend

565
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:51,039
it as a moral obligation that can't be

566
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:54,200
translated back into purely

567
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:58,850
consent-based terms can't be translated

568
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:04,210
into liberal terms where's Ajay Kumar

569
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:09,259
Ajay everybody seems to know you all

570
00:31:09,259 --> 00:31:09,679
right

571
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:12,499
let's hear from Ajay you said I in the

572
00:31:12,499 --> 00:31:14,570
same way I feel I owe more to my family

573
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:16,490
than to the general community I owe more

574
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:18,710
to my country than to humanity in

575
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:21,379
general because my country holds a great

576
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:24,769
stake in my identity it is not prejudice

577
00:31:24,769 --> 00:31:28,249
for me to love my country unless it is

578
00:31:28,249 --> 00:31:30,710
prejudice for me to love my parents more

579
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:33,769
than somebody else's so Ajay what would

580
00:31:33,769 --> 00:31:37,639
you say to this group stand up I think

581
00:31:37,639 --> 00:31:40,429
that there's some fundamental moral

582
00:31:40,429 --> 00:31:42,200
obligation that comes from a

583
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,960
communitarian responsibility to people

584
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,309
and groups that form your identity I

585
00:31:46,309 --> 00:31:48,889
mean even like I'll give the example

586
00:31:48,889 --> 00:31:50,690
that you know there are a lot of things

587
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:52,039
about our government right now that I'm

588
00:31:52,039 --> 00:31:54,590
not in favor of but part of my identity

589
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:57,139
is that America value is a free society

590
00:31:57,139 --> 00:31:59,690
where we can object to certain things

591
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:01,100
and I think that's an expression of

592
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:05,059
patriotism as well and I'd go back to

593
00:32:05,059 --> 00:32:06,559
the parent example or even in Harvard I

594
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:09,139
think you know I owe more to my

595
00:32:09,139 --> 00:32:10,879
roommates because they make up my Tenny

596
00:32:10,879 --> 00:32:12,200
than I do to the Harvard community as a

597
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,119
whole and I think that applies to our

598
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:15,769
country because there are certain things

599
00:32:15,769 --> 00:32:17,570
that growing up here yes we can't choose

600
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:19,159
if we can't choose our parents things

601
00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:21,230
like that but it makes up part of our

602
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,450
identity okay who would like to take

603
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:28,340
that on hike yeah both the obligation to

604
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:32,179
others simply by virtue of being in

605
00:32:32,179 --> 00:32:35,269
their their um being influenced by them

606
00:32:35,269 --> 00:32:37,369
I'm a German citizen and if I had been

607
00:32:37,369 --> 00:32:40,129
born 80 years earlier than I would have

608
00:32:40,129 --> 00:32:43,129
been a citizen of Nazi Germany and for

609
00:32:43,129 --> 00:32:44,749
some reason I just don't think that I

610
00:32:44,749 --> 00:32:48,049
would have to feel obligated towards

611
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:51,259
Germany um because I benefited from

612
00:32:51,259 --> 00:32:51,970
action

613
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,790
of Nazis I mean I guess my response to

614
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:56,740
that would be you have hundreds of

615
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:58,090
thousands of protestors the United

616
00:32:58,090 --> 00:32:59,980
States right now who hold up signs that

617
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,140
say pieces patriotic and I'm sure there

618
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,250
are people in this room who don't agree

619
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:05,380
with that I personally do and I would

620
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:07,240
say that they're strongly objecting to

621
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,400
basically everything the Bush

622
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,440
administration is doing right now but

623
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,030
they still consider themselves loving

624
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:14,290
their country because they're furthering

625
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:16,210
the cause of what they see is best for

626
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:17,710
the country and I tend to agree with

627
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:19,780
that as a patriotic movement well but

628
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:22,750
how is that then how do you still favor

629
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:25,060
your country how is that so patriotic I

630
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,980
mean isn't that more sentimental

631
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:29,140
attachment where's the obligation

632
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:33,460
they're not to bring this back to John

633
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,380
Locke but I'd like to bring this back to

634
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:35,980
John Locke

635
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:41,170
so I mean in his conception of um you

636
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:43,180
know when people joined society there's

637
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:45,550
there's still some outlet like if you if

638
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:47,320
you're not satisfied with your society

639
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,630
you know you do have a means of exit

640
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:51,010
even though we had a lot of concerns

641
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:53,050
about how you're born and it's not very

642
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:54,640
feasible he still provides that option

643
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,700
if we want to say that your obligation

644
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,740
to society is a moral one that means

645
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:02,500
that prior to knowing exactly what that

646
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,880
society is going to be like or what your

647
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,230
position is going to be in that society

648
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:06,910
that means that you have a binding

649
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:09,340
obligation to like a complete unknown

650
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:11,230
body that that could be you know

651
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:13,090
completely foreign to all of your

652
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:14,889
personal beliefs or you know what you

653
00:34:14,889 --> 00:34:16,659
would hope to be do you think that that

654
00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:18,310
kind of communal obligation or

655
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:21,429
patriotism means writing the community a

656
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:25,480
a blank moral check basically yeah like

657
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,790
I think that we can you know I think

658
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:30,489
it's reasonable to say that as you grow

659
00:34:30,489 --> 00:34:31,780
and as you develop within that community

660
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:34,210
that you acquire some type of obligation

661
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:36,040
based on reciprocity but to say that you

662
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,570
have a moral obligation I think requires

663
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:41,739
a stronger justification well anyone

664
00:34:41,739 --> 00:34:44,199
else like to address that I guess we

665
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:45,639
could say that you you could argue that

666
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:47,469
you're morally obliged to society by the

667
00:34:47,469 --> 00:34:49,239
fact that there is this reciprocity I

668
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:50,770
think it's the idea that you know we

669
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:52,389
participate in society we pay our taxes

670
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:54,820
we vote this is why we could say that we

671
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,739
owe something to society but beyond that

672
00:34:56,739 --> 00:34:58,210
I don't think there's anything inherent

673
00:34:58,210 --> 00:34:59,710
in the fact that we are members of the

674
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:01,510
society itself that we owe and anything

675
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:04,480
I think is insofar as we as the society

676
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:04,900
gives

677
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,700
something gives us protection safety

678
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,710
security then we owe the society

679
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:10,569
something but nothing beyond what we

680
00:35:10,569 --> 00:35:13,270
give this assign who wants to take that

681
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:19,569
on Rahul I don't think we I don't think

682
00:35:19,569 --> 00:35:21,910
we give the community a blank moral

683
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:24,279
check in that sense I think we only give

684
00:35:24,279 --> 00:35:27,579
it a blank moral check when we abdicate

685
00:35:27,579 --> 00:35:29,740
our sense of civic responsibility and

686
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:31,930
when we say that the debate doesn't

687
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:34,029
matter because patriotism is a vice I

688
00:35:34,029 --> 00:35:36,579
think that patriotism is important

689
00:35:36,579 --> 00:35:38,319
because it gives us a sense of community

690
00:35:38,319 --> 00:35:40,270
a sense of common civic virtue that we

691
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:42,609
can engage in the issues even if you

692
00:35:42,609 --> 00:35:45,640
don't agree with the way the government

693
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:48,160
is acting you can still love your

694
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,260
country and hate the way it's acting and

695
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:52,210
I think because out of that love of

696
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:55,930
country you can debate with other people

697
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:58,270
and have respect for their views but

698
00:35:58,270 --> 00:36:01,329
still engaging in debate if you just say

699
00:36:01,329 --> 00:36:05,020
that you know page 2 is a vice you drop

700
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,579
out of that debate and you and you see

701
00:36:06,579 --> 00:36:08,440
the ground to people who are more

702
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,510
fundamentalist who have a stronger view

703
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:13,200
and who make worse the community it

704
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,730
instead we should engage the other

705
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:17,619
members of the community on that same

706
00:36:17,619 --> 00:36:21,010
moral ground well now this what we hear

707
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:24,029
from a Jain Rahul is a very pluralistic

708
00:36:24,029 --> 00:36:26,890
argumentative critically minded

709
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:30,180
patriotism whereas what we hear from

710
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:33,400
ICANN the critics of patriotism here is

711
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:37,150
the worry that to take patriotic

712
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:41,010
obligation in a communal way seriously

713
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:44,410
involves a kind of loyalty that doesn't

714
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:46,960
let us just pick and choose among the

715
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,750
beliefs or actions or or practices of

716
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:53,770
our country what more what's left of

717
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:59,319
loyalty if all we're talking about Ajay

718
00:36:59,319 --> 00:37:01,390
and Rahul if all we're talking about is

719
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:03,940
loyalty to principles of justice that

720
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:07,420
may happen to be embodied in our

721
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:09,579
community or not as the case may be in

722
00:37:09,579 --> 00:37:12,789
if not then we can can reject its course

723
00:37:12,789 --> 00:37:15,520
I don't know I've sort of given a reply

724
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,190
I got carried away I'm sorry who liked

725
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:21,480
go ahead Julia yeah I think that

726
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,440
patriotism you needed to find what that

727
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,180
is it sounds like you know you would

728
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:26,410
normally think that we are given a more

729
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,089
weak definition here page which is

730
00:37:28,089 --> 00:37:29,349
amongst us but it almost sounds like

731
00:37:29,349 --> 00:37:31,420
your definition is merely to have some

732
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,039
sort of civic involvement in debating

733
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:34,599
within your society and I think that

734
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:36,549
that kind of undermines maybe the moral

735
00:37:36,549 --> 00:37:38,470
some of the moral worth of patriotism as

736
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:40,510
a virtue as well I think if you can

737
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:41,770
consent to a stronger form of patriotism

738
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:45,280
if you want that's a stronger I guess

739
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,569
more obligation and even what you're

740
00:37:46,569 --> 00:37:49,500
suggesting what we really need to

741
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:54,549
sharpen the issue is an example from the

742
00:37:54,549 --> 00:37:58,150
defenders of communitarianism of a case

743
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:02,200
where loyalty can actually compete with

744
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:06,670
and possibly outweigh universal

745
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:07,990
principles of justice

746
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:10,329
isn't that what that's the test they

747
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:13,359
really need to meet isn't it all right

748
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:15,490
so that's the test you need to meet or

749
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:17,829
any any among you who would like to

750
00:38:17,829 --> 00:38:21,549
defend obligations of membership or

751
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:24,670
solidarity independent of ones that

752
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:29,470
happen to embody just principles who has

753
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:35,230
an example of a kind of loyalty that can

754
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:40,059
and should compete with universal moral

755
00:38:40,059 --> 00:38:44,920
claims respect for persons go ahead yeah

756
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,440
if I were working on an egg problem set

757
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,690
for example and I saw that my roommate

758
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:52,420
was cheating that might be a bad thing

759
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:54,579
for her for him to do but I wouldn't

760
00:38:54,579 --> 00:38:56,799
turn him in you would not turn him in I

761
00:38:56,799 --> 00:38:58,299
wouldn't turn him in and I think that I

762
00:38:58,299 --> 00:38:59,859
would argue that's the right thing to do

763
00:38:59,859 --> 00:39:02,020
because of my obligation him you know it

764
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:04,150
may be wrong but that's what I would do

765
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:05,319
and you know I think that's what most

766
00:39:05,319 --> 00:39:07,480
people would do as well right that's now

767
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:10,480
there's a fair test he's not slipping

768
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,400
out by saying he's invoking in the name

769
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,190
of community some universal principles

770
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:17,400
of justice what's your name stay there

771
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:22,510
what's your name it's dan dan so what do

772
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:24,940
people think about Dan's case that's a

773
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:27,460
harder case for the ethic of loyalty

774
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:31,780
isn't it but a truer test how

775
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:40,090
I agree with Dan so loyalty Dan loyalty

776
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:43,500
has its part a sense it

777
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:52,740
how many disagree with Stan Peggy oh

778
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:55,600
well I agree with Dan but I agree that

779
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,490
it's a choice that we make but it's not

780
00:39:57,490 --> 00:39:59,770
necessarily right or wrong I mean I'm

781
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:01,180
agreeing that I'm going to make the

782
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:03,160
wrong choice because I'm gonna choose my

783
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,020
roommate but I also recognize that

784
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:09,070
choice isn't morally right so you're

785
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:11,260
still translating even Dan's loyalty

786
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,610
you're saying well that's a matter of

787
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:17,490
choice but what's the right thing to do

788
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:20,410
the most people put up their hand saying

789
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:23,290
Dan would be right to stand by his

790
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:32,350
roommate and not turn him in let's go

791
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:34,570
ahead also I think as a roommate you

792
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:38,110
have insider information and that might

793
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:39,760
not be something you want to use that's

794
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,280
might be something unfair to hold

795
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,050
against you know you're spending that

796
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:45,970
much time with the roommate obviously

797
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:47,680
you're going to learn things about about

798
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,690
him and I don't think it's fair to

799
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:53,830
reveal that to a greater community but

800
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:55,960
it's loyalty Wojtek you you agree with

801
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,450
Dan that yes oil T is a ethic at stake

802
00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:01,540
here absolutely you don't have a duty to

803
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:03,700
tell the truth to report someone who

804
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:07,930
cheated not if you're if you've been

805
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:09,550
advantaged into getting that kind of

806
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:13,540
information before our critics of

807
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:16,390
patriotism leave I want to give you

808
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:19,770
another version a more public example of

809
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:22,120
what will I guess we should call it

810
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:25,870
Dan's dilemma Dan's dilemma of loyalty

811
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:27,550
and I want to get the reaction of people

812
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:30,640
to this this came up a few years ago in

813
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,400
Massachusetts does anyone know who this

814
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:37,780
man is Billy Bulger that's right

815
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:40,480
who is Billy Bulger he was president the

816
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,720
Massachusetts state Senate for many

817
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,670
one of the most powerful politicians in

818
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:46,559
Massachusetts and then he became

819
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:47,849
president of the University of

820
00:41:47,849 --> 00:41:50,579
Massachusetts now

821
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:52,650
Billy Bulger did you hear the story

822
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:56,119
about him that bears on Dan's dilemma

823
00:41:56,119 --> 00:42:00,510
Billy Bulger has a brother named Whitey

824
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:07,769
Bulger and this is Whitey Bulger his

825
00:42:07,769 --> 00:42:11,430
brother whitey is on the FBI's most

826
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:15,529
wanted list alleged to be a notorious

827
00:42:15,529 --> 00:42:20,430
gang leader in Boston responsible for

828
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:23,250
many murders and now a fugitive from

829
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:28,279
justice but when when the US Attorney

830
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:33,269
they called Billy Bulger then the

831
00:42:33,269 --> 00:42:34,650
president of the University of

832
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:37,410
Massachusetts before the grand jury and

833
00:42:37,410 --> 00:42:39,690
wanted information on the whereabouts of

834
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:43,920
his brother this fugitive and he refused

835
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:49,109
to give it us attorney said just to be

836
00:42:49,109 --> 00:42:51,990
clear mr. Bulger you feel more loyalty

837
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:54,269
to your brother than to the people of

838
00:42:54,269 --> 00:42:56,240
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and

839
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,710
here's what Billy Bulger said I never

840
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:01,529
thought of it that way but I do have a

841
00:43:01,529 --> 00:43:03,990
loyalty to my brother I care about him I

842
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:06,630
hope that I'm never helpful to anyone

843
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:08,970
against him I don't have an obligation

844
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:15,180
to help anyone catch my brother and you

845
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:18,599
would agree how many would agree with

846
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:25,710
the position of Billy Bulger let me give

847
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:27,420
one other example and then we'll let the

848
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:30,089
critics reply the critics of loyalty as

849
00:43:30,089 --> 00:43:33,869
we'll describe it here's a an even more

850
00:43:33,869 --> 00:43:36,779
fateful example from a figure in

851
00:43:36,779 --> 00:43:43,289
American history robert e lee now robert

852
00:43:43,289 --> 00:43:45,359
e lee on the eve of the civil war was an

853
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:48,089
officer of the Union Army he opposed

854
00:43:48,089 --> 00:43:52,039
secession in fact regarded as treason

855
00:43:52,039 --> 00:43:54,970
when war loomed

856
00:43:54,970 --> 00:43:58,160
Lincoln offered Lee to be the commanding

857
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:01,550
general of the Union Army and Lee

858
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:05,510
refused and he described in a letter to

859
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:09,170
his sons why he refused with all my

860
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:11,030
devotion to the Union he wrote I have

861
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:12,880
not been able to make up my mind to

862
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,860
raise my hand against my relatives my

863
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:19,490
children my home by which he meant

864
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:23,210
Virginia the Union is dissolved I shall

865
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:25,640
return to my native state and share the

866
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:28,010
miseries of my people save in her

867
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:30,680
defense I will draw my sword

868
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:37,370
no more here's a real test Dan for your

869
00:44:37,370 --> 00:44:42,260
principle of loyalty because here is the

870
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:45,680
cause of the war against not only to

871
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,890
save the Union but against slavery and

872
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:51,770
Lee is going to fight for Virginia even

873
00:44:51,770 --> 00:44:55,400
though he doesn't share the desire of

874
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:58,610
the southern states to secede now the

875
00:44:58,610 --> 00:45:00,440
communitarian would say there is

876
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:04,190
something admirable in that whether or

877
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:05,900
not the decision was ultimately right

878
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:08,330
there's something admirable and the

879
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:09,710
communitarian would say we can't even

880
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:11,200
make sense

881
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:16,010
rina we can't make sense of Lee's

882
00:45:16,010 --> 00:45:18,710
dilemma as a moral dilemma and thus we

883
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:21,550
acknowledge that the claim of loyalty

884
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:24,290
arising from his sense of narrative of

885
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:27,260
who he is is immoral not just

886
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:31,430
sentimental emotional tug all right who

887
00:45:31,430 --> 00:45:34,760
would like to respond to Dan's loyalty

888
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:38,300
to Billy Bulger's loyalty or to robert e

889
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:40,370
lee's loyalty to virginia what do you

890
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:42,890
say it Julia okay well I think that this

891
00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:44,630
is these are some classic examples of

892
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:46,250
you know multiple spheres of influence

893
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:47,750
and that you have conflicting

894
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:49,550
communities that your family in your

895
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:51,440
country I think that's one reason why

896
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,570
the idea of choice in your obligation is

897
00:45:53,570 --> 00:45:56,150
so important because how else can you

898
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:58,310
resolve this you have if you're morally

899
00:45:58,310 --> 00:45:59,950
obligated and there's no way out of this

900
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:02,300
need for loyalty to both communities

901
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:04,670
your tract there's nothing you can do

902
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:06,870
you have to make a choice

903
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:09,000
and I think that being able to choose

904
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,010
based on other characteristics than

905
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:12,540
merely you know the arbitrary fact that

906
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:13,680
you're a member of this community is

907
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,510
important otherwise it's left to use

908
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:18,660
randomness well Julia the issue isn't

909
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:21,210
whether these whether Dan makes a choice

910
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:23,910
or Billy Bulger or robert e lee of

911
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:25,620
course they make a choice the question

912
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:28,140
is on what grounds on what principle

913
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:30,480
should they choose the communitarian

914
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,280
doesn't deny that there's a choice to be

915
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:35,070
made the question is which choice on

916
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:39,680
what grounds and should loyalty as such

917
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:44,460
way Andre now you want to alright go

918
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:46,890
ahead what do you say why one of the

919
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:48,300
things we've noticed in the three

920
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:50,070
examples is that the people who've all

921
00:46:50,070 --> 00:46:52,890
chosen the most immediate community of

922
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:54,660
which they're part the more local one

923
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:56,430
and I think there's something to be said

924
00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:58,950
for that it's not just random they're

925
00:46:58,950 --> 00:47:00,330
there I mean there doesn't seem to be

926
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:02,520
conflict because they know which one is

927
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,170
more important and it's their family

928
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:08,820
over the ak10 class their state over

929
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:10,950
their country and their family over the

930
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:13,410
Commonwealth of Massachusetts so I think

931
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:15,630
that's the answer to which is more

932
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:17,580
important you think that the local the

933
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:21,000
more particular is always the weightier

934
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,490
morally Andre well I mean there seems to

935
00:47:23,490 --> 00:47:25,560
be a trend in the three cases I would

936
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:27,510
agree with that I think and I think most

937
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:29,790
of us would agree that your family takes

938
00:47:29,790 --> 00:47:32,970
precedence over the United States

939
00:47:32,970 --> 00:47:38,010
perhaps which is why you go with dan dan

940
00:47:38,010 --> 00:47:41,370
loyalty to the roommate over act 10 and

941
00:47:41,370 --> 00:47:44,010
the truth yeah exactly

942
00:47:44,010 --> 00:47:48,180
I would because I mean I need

943
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:52,230
truth-telling not the truth of act n yes

944
00:47:52,230 --> 00:47:57,930
all right so we understand yes but on

945
00:47:57,930 --> 00:47:59,910
the same example in terms of family you

946
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:01,620
had cases in the civil war where brother

947
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:03,390
was pitted against brother on both sides

948
00:48:03,390 --> 00:48:04,980
of the war where they chose country

949
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:07,650
instead of family so I think the exact

950
00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:09,840
same more shows that different people

951
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:11,190
have different means of making these

952
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:13,350
choices and that there is no one set of

953
00:48:13,350 --> 00:48:15,570
values or one set of morality that

954
00:48:15,570 --> 00:48:17,280
communitarians can stick to and

955
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:18,330
personally I think that's the biggest

956
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:20,000
problem with communitarians

957
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,369
that we don't have one set of standard

958
00:48:22,369 --> 00:48:25,090
moral obligations and tell me your name

959
00:48:25,090 --> 00:48:29,510
Samantha so Samantha you agree with

960
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:31,480
Patrick Patrick's point the other day

961
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:34,160
that there may be if we allow

962
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:37,090
obligations to be defined by community

963
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:40,220
identification or membership they may

964
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:43,160
conflict there may they may overlap they

965
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:45,890
may compete and there is no clear

966
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:48,710
principled Andre says there's a clear

967
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:51,619
principle the most particular the other

968
00:48:51,619 --> 00:48:53,480
day in Nicola who is sitting over here

969
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:56,890
whereas Nicola said the most universal

970
00:48:56,890 --> 00:49:01,520
you're saying Samantha the scale of the

971
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,920
community as such can't be the decisive

972
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:07,099
moral factor so there has to be some

973
00:49:07,099 --> 00:49:13,640
other moral judgement all right let's

974
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:15,980
first let's let our defence our critics

975
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:19,010
of communal patriotism let's express our

976
00:49:19,010 --> 00:49:21,290
appreciation and thank them for their

977
00:49:21,290 --> 00:49:24,290
having stood up and responded to these

978
00:49:24,290 --> 00:49:28,820
arguments to find the issue let's turn

979
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:32,450
to the implications for justice of the

980
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:34,540
positions that we've heard discussed

981
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:42,680
here one of the worries underlying these

982
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:47,030
multiple objections to the idea of

983
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:49,190
loyalty or membership as having

984
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:53,510
independent moral weight is that it

985
00:49:53,510 --> 00:49:56,869
seems to argue that there is no way of

986
00:49:56,869 --> 00:50:00,170
finding principles of justice that are

987
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:04,040
detached from conceptions of the good

988
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:08,240
life as they may be lived in any

989
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:12,349
particular community suppose the

990
00:50:12,349 --> 00:50:14,450
communitarian argument is right suppose

991
00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:16,700
the priority of the right over the good

992
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:21,560
can't be sustained suppose instead the

993
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:25,130
justice and rights unavoidably are bound

994
00:50:25,130 --> 00:50:30,080
up with conceptions of the good does

995
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:31,680
that mean

996
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:36,710
that justice is simply a creature of

997
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:40,110
convention of the values that happen to

998
00:50:40,110 --> 00:50:43,080
prevail in any given community at any

999
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:47,750
given time one of the writings we have

1000
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:51,750
among the communitarian critics is by

1001
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:56,250
Michael Walzer he draws the implications

1002
00:50:56,250 --> 00:50:59,730
of justice this way justice is relative

1003
00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:02,460
to social meanings a given society is

1004
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:06,090
just if it's substantive life has lived

1005
00:51:06,090 --> 00:51:08,760
in a certain way in a way that is

1006
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:11,730
faithful to the shared understandings of

1007
00:51:11,730 --> 00:51:17,640
the members so Walters account seems to

1008
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:22,700
bear out the worry that if we can't find

1009
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:24,660
independent principles of justice

1010
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:27,240
independent that is from conceptions of

1011
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:29,370
the good that prevail in any given

1012
00:51:29,370 --> 00:51:33,600
community that we're simply left with

1013
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:36,630
justice being a matter of fidelity or

1014
00:51:36,630 --> 00:51:39,450
faithfulness to the shared

1015
00:51:39,450 --> 00:51:42,060
understandings or values or conventions

1016
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:44,520
that prevail in any given society at any

1017
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:50,930
given time but is that an adequate way

1018
00:51:50,930 --> 00:52:01,680
of thinking about justice well let's

1019
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:06,060
take a look at a short clip from the

1020
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:09,270
documentary eyes on the prize goes back

1021
00:52:09,270 --> 00:52:14,570
in the 1950s in the south here are some

1022
00:52:14,570 --> 00:52:20,090
situated American Southerners who

1023
00:52:20,090 --> 00:52:22,800
believe in the tradition in the shared

1024
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:27,030
understandings of segregation listen to

1025
00:52:27,030 --> 00:52:29,490
the arguments they make about loyalty

1026
00:52:29,490 --> 00:52:33,290
and tradition and see if they don't make

1027
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:37,950
you uneasy about tying arguments about

1028
00:52:37,950 --> 00:52:40,800
justice to the shared understandings or

1029
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:44,100
traditions that prevail in any given

1030
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:45,329
society at the moment

1031
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:50,099
it's from eclipse this land is composed

1032
00:52:50,099 --> 00:52:53,549
of two different cultures of white

1033
00:52:53,549 --> 00:52:56,219
culture and a colored culture and I live

1034
00:52:56,219 --> 00:53:00,479
close to them all my life but I'm told

1035
00:53:00,479 --> 00:53:02,880
now that we've mistreated them and that

1036
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,459
we must change and these changes are

1037
00:53:05,459 --> 00:53:08,089
coming faster than I expected

1038
00:53:08,089 --> 00:53:13,680
and I'm required to make decisions on a

1039
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:18,089
basis of a new way of thinking and it's

1040
00:53:18,089 --> 00:53:20,640
difficult difficult for me it's

1041
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:25,140
difficult for all of them well there you

1042
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:26,209
have it

1043
00:53:26,209 --> 00:53:29,249
narrative selves situated selves

1044
00:53:29,249 --> 00:53:34,589
invoking tradition doesn't that show us

1045
00:53:34,589 --> 00:53:37,950
that justice can't be tied to the shared

1046
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:40,410
understandings of goods that prevail in

1047
00:53:40,410 --> 00:53:43,019
any given community at any given time or

1048
00:53:43,019 --> 00:53:46,430
is there a way of rescuing that claim

1049
00:53:46,430 --> 00:53:49,890
from this example think about that

1050
00:53:49,890 --> 00:53:51,630
question and we'll return to it next
