00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:07,120
funding for this program is provided by

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,639
additional funding provided by

3
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,200
this is a course about justice and we

4
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,280
begin with a story

5
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,200
suppose you're the driver of a trolley

6
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,520
car and your trolley car is hurtling

7
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,399
down the track at 60 miles an hour

8
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,320
and at the end of the track you notice

9
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,200
five workers working on the track

10
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,760
you try to stop but you can't your

11
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,600
brakes don't work

12
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,480
you feel desperate because you know

13
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,160
that if you crash into these five

14
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,359
workers

15
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,199
they will all die

16
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,799
let's assume you know that for sure

17
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,880
and so you feel helpless

18
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,200
until you notice that there is

19
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,880
off to the right

20
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,880
a side track

21
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,280
and at the end of that track

22
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,960
there's one worker

23
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,799
working on the track

24
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,200
your steering wheel works

25
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,720
so you can

26
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,600
turn the trolley car if you want to

27
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,479
onto the side track

28
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,159
killing the one

29
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,960
but sparing the five

30
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,759
here's our first question

31
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,560
what's the right thing to do

32
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,399
what would you do let's take a poll

33
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,000
how many

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,880
would

35
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,600
turn the trolley car onto the side track

36
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,320
raise your hands

37
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,000
how many wouldn't how many would go

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,720
straight ahead

39
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,960
keep your hands up those of you who

40
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,840
would go straight ahead

41
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,680
a handful of people would the vast

42
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,080
majority would turn

43
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,679
let's hear first

44
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,440
now we need to begin to investigate the

45
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,840
reasons why you think

46
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,760
it's the right thing to do let's begin

47
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,640
with those in the majority who would

48
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,599
turn

49
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,400
to go onto the side track why would you

50
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,360
do it

51
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,440
what would be your reason

52
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,360
who's willing to volunteer

53
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,760
a reason

54
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,879
go ahead stand up um because it it can't

55
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,040
be right to kill five people when you

56
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,879
can only kill one person instead

57
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,000
it wouldn't be right to kill five

58
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,840
if you could kill one person instead

59
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,239
that's a good reason

60
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,800
that's a good reason

61
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,239
who else does everybody agree with that

62
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,640
reason

63
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,120
go ahead

64
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,319
um well i was thinking it was the same

65
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,360
reason on

66
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,599
9 11 we regard the people who who flew

67
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,360
the plane into the

68
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,440
pennsylvania field as heroes because

69
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,720
they chose to kill the people in the

70
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,159
plane and not kill more people in

71
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,920
big buildings

72
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,080
so the principle there was the same on 9

73
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,360
11. it's a tragic circumstance but

74
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,920
better to kill one and so that five can

75
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,120
live

76
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,879
is that the reason most of you had those

77
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,400
of you who would turn yes

78
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,280
let's hear now from

79
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,200
those in the minority

80
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,400
those who wouldn't turn

81
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,680
yes well uh i think that's the same type

82
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,760
of mentality that justifies genocide and

83
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,280
totalitarianism

84
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,680
in order to say save one type of race

85
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,159
you wipe out the other

86
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,920
so what would you do in this case you

87
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,120
would

88
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,200
to avoid

89
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,599
the horrors of genocide

90
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,760
you would crash into the five and kill

91
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,840
them

92
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,239
presumably yes

93
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,280
yeah

94
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,599
okay who else

95
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,200
that's a brave answer thank you

96
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,519
let's consider

97
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,680
another trolley car case

98
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,358
and see

99
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,680
whether

100
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,120
those of you in the majority

101
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,639
want to adhere to the principle

102
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,400
better that one should die so that five

103
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,240
should live this time you're not the

104
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,759
driver of the trolley car you're an

105
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,840
onlooker

106
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,680
you're standing on a bridge overlooking

107
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,320
a trolley car track

108
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,440
and down the track comes a trolley car

109
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,360
at the end of the track are five workers

110
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,520
the brakes don't work

111
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,680
the trolley car is about to careen into

112
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,680
the five and kill them

113
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,960
and now

114
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,560
you're not the driver

115
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,960
you really feel helpless

116
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,800
until you notice

117
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,840
standing next to you

118
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,400
leaning over

119
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,680
the bridge

120
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,199
is a very fat man

121
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,039
and

122
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,720
you could

123
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,000
give him

124
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,479
a shove

125
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,400
he would fall over the bridge

126
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,280
onto the track

127
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,039
right in the way

128
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,160
of the

129
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,000
trolley car

130
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,639
he would die but he would spare the five

131
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,720
now

132
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,880
how many would push

133
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,880
the fat man over the bridge raise your

134
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,199
hand

135
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,800
how many wouldn't

136
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,759
most people wouldn't

137
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,520
here's the obvious question

138
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,600
what became of the principle

139
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,240
better to save five lives even if it

140
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,319
means sacrificing one what became of the

141
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,280
principle that almost everyone endorsed

142
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,120
in the first case

143
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,800
i need to hear from someone who was in

144
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,759
the majority in both cases how do you

145
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,400
explain the difference between the two

146
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,759
yes

147
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,919
the second one i guess involves an

148
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,479
active choice of uh pushing the person

149
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:23,680
down which

150
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,240
um i guess the that person himself would

151
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,560
otherwise uh not have been involved in

152
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,280
this situation at all and so to

153
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,600
choose on his behalf i guess

154
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,240
to uh

155
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,600
involve him in something that he

156
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,919
otherwise would have escaped is

157
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,160
i guess more than what you have in the

158
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,560
first case where the three parties the

159
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,639
the driver and the the two sets of

160
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,039
workers are already i guess in the

161
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,319
situation

162
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,800
but the guy working the one on the track

163
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,880
off to the side

164
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,120
he didn't choose to sacrifice his life

165
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,880
any more than the fat man did did he

166
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,479
that's true but he was on the tracks and

167
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,479
you this guy was on the bridge

168
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,120
go ahead you can come back if you want

169
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,039
all right it's a hard question

170
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,880
all right you did well you did very well

171
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,639
it's a hard question

172
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:19,440
um

173
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,880
who else

174
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,240
can

175
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,840
find a way of reconciling

176
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,599
the reaction of the majority in these

177
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,280
two cases yes well i guess um in the

178
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,039
first case where you have the one worker

179
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:34,639
and the five

180
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,120
uh it's it's choice between those two

181
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,639
and you have to make a certain choice

182
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:39,759
and people are going to die because of

183
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,840
the trolley car not necessarily because

184
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,599
of your direct actions the trolley car

185
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:44,800
is a runway

186
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,639
thing and you're making a split second

187
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,599
choice

188
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,840
whereas pushing the fat man over is an

189
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,080
actual act of murder on your part

190
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,479
you have control over that whereas you

191
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,000
may not have control over the trolley

192
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,120
car

193
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,560
so i think it's a slightly different

194
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,840
situation

195
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,080
all right who has a reply is that is no

196
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,240
that's that's good who has a way

197
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,080
who wants to reply

198
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,800
is that a way out of this

199
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,240
um i don't think that's a very good

200
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,800
reason because you choose to it's either

201
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,560
way you have to choose who dies because

202
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,240
you either choose to turn and kill the

203
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,080
person which is an active conscious

204
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,479
thought to turn or you choose to push

205
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,120
the fat man over which is also an active

206
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,280
conscious action so either way you're

207
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,440
making a choice

208
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,360
do you want to reply

209
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,879
well i'm not really sure if that's the

210
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,320
case it just still seems kind of

211
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,000
different the act of actually

212
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,320
pushing someone over onto the tracks and

213
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,039
killing him you are actually killing him

214
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,719
yourself you're pushing him with your

215
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,640
own hands you're pushing him and that's

216
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,519
different

217
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,680
than steering something that is going to

218
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,320
cause death into another

219
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,000
you know it doesn't really sound right

220
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,040
saying it now no it's good i'm up here

221
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,880
that's good what's your name andrew

222
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,560
andrew let me ask you this question

223
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,880
andrew yes

224
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,519
suppose

225
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,360
standing on the bridge

226
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,680
next to the man i didn't have to push

227
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,320
him suppose he were standing over a trap

228
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,920
door that i could open by turning a

229
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,120
steering wheel like that

230
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,480
would you turn

231
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,480
for some reason that that still just

232
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,399
seems more wrong

233
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,760
right i mean

234
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,760
maybe if you accidentally like leaned

235
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,200
into the steering wheel or something

236
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,600
like that

237
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,880
but uh or or say that the cars is

238
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,880
hurtling towards a switch that will drop

239
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,640
the trap

240
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,760
um

241
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,080
then i could agree fair enough it still

242
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,600
seems

243
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,680
wrong in a way that it doesn't seem

244
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,839
wrong in the first case to turn you say

245
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,360
and in another way i mean in the first

246
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,200
situation you're involved directly with

247
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,880
the situation and the second one you're

248
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,720
an onlooker as well all right so you

249
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,240
have the choice of becoming involved or

250
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,320
not by pushing the fact that let's let's

251
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,200
forget for the moment about this case

252
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,959
that's good

253
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,720
uh let's imagine a different case this

254
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,120
time you're a doctor in an emergency

255
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,160
room

256
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,399
and six patients come to you

257
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,519
they've been in a terrible trolley car

258
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,519
wreck

259
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,320
five of them sustained moderate injuries

260
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,320
one is severely injured you could spend

261
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,440
all day

262
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,240
caring for the one severely injured

263
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,440
victim

264
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,680
but in that time the five would die or

265
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,360
you could look after the five restore

266
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,040
them to health but during that time the

267
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,040
one severely injured

268
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,680
person would die how many would save the

269
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,360
five

270
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,519
now is the doctor how many would save

271
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,920
the one

272
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,959
very few people just a handful of people

273
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,200
same reason i assume

274
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,720
one life versus five

275
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,720
now consider

276
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,800
another doctor case

277
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,839
this time you're a transplant surgeon

278
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,480
and you have five patients each in

279
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,920
desperate need

280
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,000
of an organ transplant in order to

281
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,360
survive

282
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,920
one needs a heart one a lung

283
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,800
one a kidney one a liver

284
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,480
and the fifth

285
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,560
a pancreas

286
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,000
and

287
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,560
you have no organ donors

288
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,720
you are about to

289
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,360
see them die

290
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,640
and then

291
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,399
it occurs to you

292
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,160
that in the next room

293
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,079
there's a healthy guy who came in for a

294
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,560
checkup

295
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,360
and he's

296
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,160
you like that

297
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,920
and he's he's taking a nap

298
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,320
you could go in very quietly

299
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,480
yank out the five organs that person

300
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,320
would die

301
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,040
but you could save the five

302
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,920
how many would do it

303
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,040
anyone

304
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,839
how many put your hands up if you would

305
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,160
do it

306
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,399
anyone in the balcony

307
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:21,680
you would

308
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,720
be careful don't lean over too much

309
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,160
what

310
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,200
uh how many wouldn't

311
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,079
all right

312
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,160
what do you say speak up in the balcony

313
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,680
you who would yank out the organs why

314
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,360
i'd actually like to explore slightly

315
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,440
alternate possibility of just taking the

316
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,600
one of the five who needs an organ who

317
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,920
dies first and using

318
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,519
therefore healthy organs to save the

319
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,000
other four

320
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,240
that's a pretty good idea

321
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,440
that's a great idea

322
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,920
except for the fact

323
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,079
that you just wrecked the philosophical

324
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,399
point

325
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,240
well let's step back from these stories

326
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,000
and these arguments

327
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,240
to notice a couple of things

328
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,959
about the way the arguments have begun

329
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,279
to unfold

330
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,240
certain

331
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,440
moral principles have already begun to

332
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,040
emerge

333
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,600
from the discussions we've had

334
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,279
and let's consider

335
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,519
what those moral principles

336
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,040
look like

337
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,959
the first moral principle that emerged

338
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,639
in the discussion

339
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:35,519
said

340
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,600
the right thing to do the moral thing to

341
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,560
do

342
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,880
depends on the consequences that will

343
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,880
result

344
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,279
from your action

345
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:46,800
at the end of the day

346
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,880
better that five should live

347
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,920
even if one must die

348
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,519
that's an example

349
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,920
of consequentialist

350
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,720
moral reasoning

351
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,720
consequentialist moral reasoning locates

352
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,120
morality in the consequences of an act

353
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,639
in the state of the world that will

354
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,000
result

355
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,560
from the thing you do

356
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,160
but then we went a little further we

357
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,560
considered those other cases

358
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,880
and people weren't so sure

359
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,480
about

360
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,240
consequentialist moral reasoning

361
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,240
when people hesitated

362
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,000
to push the fat man

363
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,519
over the bridge

364
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,360
or to yank out the organs of the

365
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,360
innocent patient

366
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,600
people gestured toward

367
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,920
reasons

368
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,120
having to do

369
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,639
with the intrinsic quality of the act

370
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:39,839
itself

371
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,399
consequences be what they may

372
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,800
people were reluctant

373
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,959
people thought it was just wrong

374
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:49,279
categorically wrong

375
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,399
to kill

376
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,120
a person an innocent person

377
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,320
even for the sake of saving five lives

378
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,639
at least people thought that in the

379
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,160
second

380
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,760
version of each story we considered

381
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,880
so

382
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,320
this points

383
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,639
to a second

384
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,839
categorical

385
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:12,399
way

386
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,320
of thinking about

387
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,800
moral reasoning categorical moral

388
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,519
reasoning locates morality in certain

389
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,680
absolute moral requirements certain

390
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,399
categorical duties and rights regardless

391
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,120
of the consequences

392
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,040
we're going to explore

393
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,639
in the days and weeks to come the

394
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,519
contrast between consequentialist and

395
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,320
categorical moral principles

396
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,240
the most influential

397
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,279
example of consequential moral reasoning

398
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:45,440
is utilitarianism a doctrine invented by

399
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,839
jeremy bentham the 18th century english

400
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,880
political philosopher

401
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,440
the most important

402
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,600
philosopher of categorical moral

403
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,639
reasoning

404
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,000
is the

405
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,959
18th century german philosopher immanuel

406
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,399
kant

407
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,880
so we will look at those two different

408
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,040
modes of moral reasoning

409
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,480
assess them and also consider others

410
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,839
if you look at the syllabus you'll

411
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,759
notice that we read a number of great

412
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,759
and famous books

413
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,000
books by aristotle

414
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,279
john locke

415
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,079
emmanuel kant john stuart mill and

416
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,759
others

417
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,600
you'll notice too from the syllabus that

418
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,000
we don't only read these books

419
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,759
we also

420
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,120
take up

421
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,199
contemporary political and legal

422
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,440
controversies that raise philosophical

423
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,800
questions

424
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,519
we will debate equality and inequality

425
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,279
affirmative action

426
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,160
free speech versus hate speech same-sex

427
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,120
marriage military conscription a range

428
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,360
of practical questions

429
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,720
why

430
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,519
not just to enliven these abstract and

431
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,120
distant books

432
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,440
but to make clear to bring out what's at

433
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,839
stake in our everyday lives including

434
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,959
our political lives

435
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,280
for philosophy

436
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,439
and so we will read these books

437
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,280
and we will debate these

438
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,400
issues and we'll see how each informs

439
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,199
and illuminates the other

440
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,959
this may sound appealing enough but here

441
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,319
i have to issue a warning

442
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,039
and the warning is this

443
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:28,160
to read these books

444
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,039
in this way

445
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,919
as an exercise in self-knowledge

446
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,760
to read them in this way carries certain

447
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,160
risks

448
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,919
risks that are both personal and

449
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,679
political

450
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,000
risks that every student of political

451
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,679
philosophy

452
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,520
has known

453
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,400
these risks spring from the fact

454
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,080
that philosophy

455
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,919
teaches us

456
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,240
and unsettles us

457
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,640
by confronting us with what we already

458
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,120
know

459
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,200
there's an irony

460
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,440
the difficulty of this course consists

461
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,360
in the fact that it teaches what you

462
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,600
already know

463
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,919
it works by taking

464
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:14,559
what we know from familiar unquestioned

465
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,320
settings

466
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,679
and making it strange

467
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,880
that's how those examples work worked

468
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,200
the hypotheticals with which we began

469
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,200
with their mix of playfulness and

470
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,720
sobriety

471
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,120
it's also how these philosophical books

472
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,200
work philosophy

473
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,360
estranges us

474
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,200
from the familiar

475
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,160
not by supplying new information

476
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,520
but by inviting and provoking

477
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,720
a new way of seeing

478
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,679
but and here's the risk

479
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:50,559
once

480
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:54,080
the familiar turns strange

481
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,440
it's never quite the same again

482
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,000
self-knowledge

483
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,720
is like lost innocence

484
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,480
however unsettling

485
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,840
you find it

486
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,120
it can never

487
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,440
be unthought

488
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,320
or unknown

489
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,039
what makes this enterprise difficult

490
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,679
but also riveting

491
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,080
is that moral and political philosophy

492
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,120
is a story

493
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,880
and you don't know where the story will

494
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,200
lead but what you do know

495
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,120
is that the story

496
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,080
is about you

497
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,880
those are the personal risks

498
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,919
now what of the political risks

499
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,840
one way of introducing a course like

500
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,799
this

501
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,480
would be to promise you

502
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,799
that by reading these books and debating

503
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,880
these issues you will become a better

504
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,520
more responsible citizen

505
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,600
you will examine the presuppositions of

506
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,280
public policy you will hone your

507
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,960
political judgment

508
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,320
you will become a more effective

509
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,160
participant in public affairs

510
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,000
but this would be a partial and

511
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,320
misleading promise

512
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,240
political philosophy for the most part

513
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,280
hasn't worked that way

514
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,400
you have to allow for the possibility

515
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,640
that political philosophy may make you a

516
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,720
worse citizen

517
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,440
rather than a better one

518
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,679
or at least a worse citizen

519
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,440
before it makes you

520
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,679
a better one

521
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:30,240
and that's because philosophy

522
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,240
is a distancing

523
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,400
even debilitating

524
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,320
activity

525
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,600
and you see this going back to socrates

526
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,000
there's a dialogue the gorgeous in which

527
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,400
one of socrates's friends

528
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,120
calocles tries to talk him out

529
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,600
of philosophizing

530
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,240
calculus tells socrates philosophy is a

531
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,159
pretty toy

532
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,400
if one indulges in it with moderation at

533
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,240
the right time of life but if one

534
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,799
pursues it further than one should it is

535
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,320
absolute

536
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,520
ruin

537
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,240
take my advice calocly says

538
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,159
abandon argument

539
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,200
learn the accomplishments of active life

540
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,520
take for your models not those people

541
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,440
who spend their time on these petty

542
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,640
quibbles

543
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,799
but those who have a good livelihood and

544
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:22,080
reputation and many other blessings

545
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,240
so calacles is really saying to philos

546
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,559
to socrates

547
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,400
quit philosophizing

548
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:33,440
get real go to business school

549
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,080
and calace did have a point

550
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,720
he had a point because philosophy

551
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,280
distances us from conventions from

552
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,840
established assumptions and from settled

553
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,159
beliefs those are the risks

554
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,480
personal and political and in the face

555
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,480
of these risks there is a characteristic

556
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,919
evasion

557
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:56,080
the name of the evasion is skepticism

558
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,159
it's the idea well it goes something

559
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,440
like this we didn't resolve once and for

560
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,520
all

561
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,840
either the cases or the principles we

562
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,440
were arguing when we began

563
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,559
and if aristotle and locke and kant and

564
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,240
mill haven't solved these questions

565
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,799
after all of these years

566
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,360
who are we to think

567
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,520
that we here in sanders theater over the

568
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,840
course of the semester can resolve

569
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:29,200
them and so maybe it's just a matter of

570
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,200
each person having his or her own

571
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,720
principles and there's nothing more to

572
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,159
be said about it no way of reasoning

573
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,080
that's the evasion the evasion of

574
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,320
skepticism to which i would offer the

575
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,320
following reply

576
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,640
it's true these questions have been

577
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,280
debated for a very long time

578
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,360
but the very fact that they have

579
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,559
recurred and persisted

580
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,400
may suggest

581
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,159
that though they're impossible in one

582
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,520
sense they're unavoidable in another

583
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,080
and the reason they're unavoidable

584
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,240
the reason they're inescapable is that

585
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,240
we live some answer

586
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,840
to these questions every day

587
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,679
so skepticism just throwing up your

588
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:15,919
hands and giving up on moral reflection

589
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,919
is no solution

590
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,440
immanuel kant

591
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,200
described very well the problem with

592
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,919
skepticism when he wrote skepticism is a

593
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,240
resting place for human reason where it

594
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,799
can reflect upon its dogmatic wanderings

595
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,799
but it is no dwelling place for

596
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,640
permanent settlement

597
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,120
simply to acquiesce in skepticism count

598
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,480
wrote can never suffice to overcome the

599
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,919
restlessness of reason

600
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,240
i've tried to suggest through these

601
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,720
stories and these arguments

602
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,679
some sense of the risks and temptations

603
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,760
of the perils and the possibilities i

604
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,360
would simply conclude by saying

605
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,919
that the aim of this course

606
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:02,000
is to awaken the restlessness of reason

607
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,480
and to see where it might lead thank you

608
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,960
very much

609
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,880
like in a situation that desperate you

610
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,919
have to do what you have to do to

611
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:19,840
survive um you have to do what you have

612
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,840
to do you got to do what you got to do

613
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,240
pretty much if you've been going 19 days

614
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,400
without any food um you know someone

615
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,840
just has to take the sacrifice someone

616
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,520
has to make a sacrifice and people can

617
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,360
survive all right that's good what's

618
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,760
your name marcus marcus what do you say

619
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,400
to marcus

620
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,039
last time

621
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,640
we started out last time

622
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,720
with some stories

623
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,720
with some moral dilemmas

624
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,559
about trolley cars

625
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,240
and about doctors

626
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,279
and healthy patients vulnerable

627
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:58,799
to being victims of organ

628
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,720
transplantation

629
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,760
we noticed two things

630
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,559
about the arguments we had

631
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,080
one had to do with the way we were

632
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,679
arguing

633
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:11,600
we began with our judgments in

634
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,360
particular cases

635
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,440
we tried to articulate the reasons or

636
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,159
the principles

637
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,760
lying behind our judgments

638
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,200
and then confronted with a new case

639
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,600
we found ourselves re-examining those

640
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,240
principles

641
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,760
revising each in the light of the other

642
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,919
and we notice the built-in pressure to

643
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:38,720
try to bring into alignment

644
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,440
our judgments about particular cases

645
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,919
and the principles we would endorse on

646
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,159
reflection

647
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,320
we also noticed something about the

648
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,320
substance of the arguments

649
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:54,240
that emerged from the discussion

650
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:56,880
we noticed that sometimes we were

651
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,440
tempted to locate the morality of an act

652
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,000
and the consequences in the results in

653
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,600
the state of the world that it brought

654
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,000
about

655
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:09,039
and we call this consequentialist moral

656
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,440
reasoning

657
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,159
but we also noticed that in some cases

658
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,400
we weren't swayed only

659
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,279
by the result

660
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,120
sometimes

661
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,039
many of us felt

662
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,440
that not just consequences but also the

663
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,600
intrinsic quality or character of the

664
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,200
act

665
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,640
matters morally

666
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,799
some people argued that there are

667
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,240
certain things that are just

668
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,480
categorically wrong

669
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,240
even if they bring about a good result

670
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,279
even

671
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,760
if they save five people at the cost of

672
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,600
one life

673
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,320
so we contrasted consequentialists

674
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,320
moral principles

675
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,840
with categorical ones

676
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,520
today

677
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,679
and in the next few days we will begin

678
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,840
to examine one of the most

679
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,400
influential versions of consequentialist

680
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,720
moral theory

681
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,320
and that's the philosophy of

682
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,320
utilitarianism

683
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,279
jeremy bentham the 18th century english

684
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,520
political philosopher

685
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,720
gave first

686
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,399
the first clear systematic expression

687
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:31,039
to the utilitarian moral theory

688
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,720
and bentham's idea

689
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:38,240
his essential idea

690
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,440
is a very simple one

691
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,720
with a lot of

692
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,840
morally intuitive

693
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,240
appeal bentham's idea is

694
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,440
the following

695
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,240
the right thing to do

696
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,520
the just thing to do

697
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,200
is to maximize

698
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,600
utility what did he mean by utility

699
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:10,000
he meant by utility the balance

700
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,200
of

701
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,440
pleasure over pain

702
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,480
happiness over suffering

703
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,120
here's how he arrived at the principle

704
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,080
of maximizing utility

705
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,240
he started out by observing

706
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,159
that all of us

707
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,880
all human beings are governed by two

708
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,120
sovereign masters

709
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,080
pain and pleasure

710
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,880
we human beings

711
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,880
like pleasure and dislike pain

712
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,600
and so we should base morality

713
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,120
whether we're thinking about what to do

714
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,960
in our own lives

715
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,240
or whether

716
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,480
as legislators or citizens we're

717
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,000
thinking about what the laws should be

718
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,120
the right thing to do individually or

719
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,840
collectively

720
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,320
is to maximize act in a way that

721
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:10,240
maximizes the overall level of happiness

722
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,600
bentham's utilitarianism is sometimes

723
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,919
summed up with the slogan the greatest

724
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:18,640
good for the greatest number

725
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,919
with this

726
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:23,039
basic principle of utility on hand let's

727
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:26,399
begin to test it and to examine it by

728
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,880
turning to another case another story

729
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,320
but this time

730
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,480
not a hypothetical story

731
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,440
a real life story the case of the queen

732
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,080
versus dudley and stevens

733
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,799
this was a 19th century british law case

734
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:41,679
that's

735
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,679
famous

736
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:47,200
and much debated in law schools

737
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,760
here's what happened in the case

738
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,159
i'll summarize the story then i want to

739
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:54,640
hear

740
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,039
how you would rule

741
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,559
imagining that you are the jury

742
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,600
a newspaper account of the time

743
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,720
described the background

744
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,440
a sadder story of disaster at sea was

745
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,080
never told than that of the survivors of

746
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,000
the yacht mignonette

747
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,640
the ship foundered in the south atlantic

748
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,520
thirteen hundred miles from the cape

749
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,520
there were four in the crew

750
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,840
dudley was the captain

751
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,799
stevens was the first mate brooks was a

752
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,000
sailor

753
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,799
all men of excellent character or so the

754
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:35,600
newspaper account tells us

755
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,240
the fourth crew member was the cabin boy

756
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,679
richard parker

757
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:42,640
17 years old

758
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,399
he was an orphan

759
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:46,640
he had no family

760
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,960
and he was on his first long voyage at

761
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,200
sea

762
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,840
he went the news account tells us rather

763
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,480
against the advice of his friends

764
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,320
he went in the hopefulness of youthful

765
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,760
ambition

766
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,760
thinking the journey would make a man of

767
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,880
him

768
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,960
sadly it was not to be

769
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,399
the facts of the case were not in

770
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,960
dispute a wave hit the ship and the

771
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,760
mignonette went down

772
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,519
the four crew members escaped to a

773
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:14,640
lifeboat

774
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,000
the only

775
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,200
food they had were two

776
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,760
cans of preserved turnips no fresh water

777
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,279
for the first three days they ate

778
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:26,399
nothing

779
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:27,840
on the fourth day

780
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,080
they opened one of the cans of turnips

781
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,360
and ate it

782
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,919
the next day they caught a turtle

783
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:36,799
together with the other can of turnips

784
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:38,080
the turtle

785
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,559
enabled them to subsist for the next few

786
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,880
days and then for eight days

787
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,559
they had nothing no food no water

788
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,799
imagine yourself in a situation like

789
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:49,760
that

790
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,559
what would you do

791
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:54,960
here's what they did

792
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,440
by now the cabin boy parker is lying at

793
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,640
the bottom of the lifeboat in the corner

794
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,200
because he had drunk seawater against

795
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,200
the advice of the others

796
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,960
and he had become ill

797
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,320
and he appeared to be dying

798
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,279
so on the 19th day dudley the captain

799
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:16,080
suggested that they should all

800
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,919
have a lottery that they should draw

801
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:20,640
lots to see who would die

802
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,679
to save the rest

803
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:26,320
brooks refused

804
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,880
he didn't like the lottery idea

805
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,519
we don't know whether this was because

806
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:33,279
he didn't want to take the chance or

807
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:35,360
because he believed in categorical moral

808
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,640
principles

809
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,480
but in any case

810
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,840
no lots were

811
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,840
drawn the next day there was still no

812
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,720
ship in sight so dudley told brooks to

813
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,960
avert his gaze and he motioned to

814
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,480
stevens

815
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,519
that the boy parker had better be killed

816
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:55,600
dudley offered a prayer

817
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,240
he told the boy his time had come

818
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,159
and he killed him with a pen knife

819
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:03,519
stabbing him in the jugular vein

820
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:06,159
brooks emerged from his conscientious

821
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:07,919
objection to share in the gruesome

822
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,519
bounty

823
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:12,320
for four days the three of them fed on

824
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,960
the body and blood of the cabin boy

825
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,799
true story

826
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:18,960
and then they were rescued

827
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,640
dudley describes their rescue

828
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,399
in his diary

829
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:27,600
with staggering euphemism quote on the

830
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,440
24th day

831
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,960
as we were having our breakfast

832
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,399
a ship appeared at last

833
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:40,399
the three survivors were picked up by a

834
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:42,399
german ship they were taken back to

835
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:44,080
falmouth in england

836
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,640
where they were arrested and tried

837
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,679
brooks turned state's witness

838
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:51,919
dudley and stevens went to trial they

839
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:54,240
didn't dispute the facts

840
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,399
they claimed they had acted out of

841
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:59,440
necessity that was their defense they

842
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,080
argued in effect better that one should

843
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,039
die

844
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:06,240
so that three could survive

845
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,320
the prosecutor

846
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,639
wasn't swayed by that argument

847
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,960
he said murder is murder and so the case

848
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,879
went to trial now imagine you are the

849
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:15,918
jury

850
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:19,199
and just to simplify the discussion

851
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,599
put aside the question of law

852
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:25,679
and let's assume that you as the jury

853
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,918
are charged with deciding

854
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:30,399
whether what they did was morally

855
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:34,119
permissible or not

856
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,320
how many

857
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,960
would vote

858
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,440
not guilty that what they did was

859
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,919
morally permissible

860
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,679
and how many would vote guilty what they

861
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:54,719
did was morally wrong

862
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:57,760
a pretty sizable majority

863
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,920
now let's see what people's reasons are

864
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,839
and let me begin with those who are in

865
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:03,520
the minority

866
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:07,280
let's hear first from the defense

867
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:09,839
of dudley and stevens

868
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:13,920
why would you morally exonerate them

869
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,839
what are your

870
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:17,839
reasons yes

871
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:19,440
i think it's i think it is morally

872
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,440
reprehensible but i think that there's a

873
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,880
distinction between what's morally

874
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,800
reprehensible and what makes someone

875
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,400
legally accountable

876
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,920
in other words you know as the judge

877
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,599
said what's what's always moral isn't

878
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:32,000
necessarily against the law and while i

879
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
don't think that necessity

880
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,160
justifies

881
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,640
theft or murder or any illegal act at

882
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,680
some point your degree of necessity does

883
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,400
in fact exonerate you from any guilt

884
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,280
okay good other defenders other voices

885
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,480
for the

886
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,240
defense

887
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,720
moral justifications for

888
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:56,320
what they did yes

889
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,280
all right thank you um i just feel like

890
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,119
in a situation that desperate you have

891
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:03,040
to do what you have to do to survive um

892
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,800
you have to do what you have to do you

893
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,640
got to do what you got to do pretty much

894
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,960
if you've been going 19 days without any

895
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,960
food um you know someone just has to

896
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,320
take the sacrifice someone has to make

897
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,400
the sacrifice and and people can survive

898
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,480
and furthermore from that let's say they

899
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,079
survive and then they become productive

900
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:20,160
members of society who go home and start

901
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,079
like a million charity organizations and

902
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,359
this and that and this and that i mean

903
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:25,040
they benefit everybody in the end yeah

904
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,320
so i mean i don't know what they did

905
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,400
afterwards they might have gone and like

906
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,760
killed more people

907
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,640
whatever but what

908
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,079
what if they were went home and they

909
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:35,760
turned out to be assassins but if they

910
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,040
weren't going home and turned out to be

911
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,560
assassins

912
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,079
well you'd want to know who they

913
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:42,480
assassinated that's true too

914
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,000
that's good

915
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,079
that's fair okay

916
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,839
all right that's good what's your name

917
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:50,400
marquise marcus all right

918
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,000
we've heard a defense

919
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
a couple of voices for the defense now

920
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,359
we need to hear

921
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:59,040
from the prosecution most people think

922
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,280
what they did was wrong

923
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,520
why

924
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,480
yes

925
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,079
one of the first things that i was

926
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:07,599
thinking was oh if they haven't been

927
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:10,720
eating for a really long time maybe

928
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,240
they

929
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,040
that they're mentally like affected and

930
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,000
so then

931
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,920
that that could be used as a defense a

932
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,400
possible argument that oh

933
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,240
they weren't in the proper state of mind

934
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,480
they weren't making decisions they might

935
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,320
otherwise be making and if that's an

936
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,720
appealing argument that that you have to

937
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,640
be an altered mindset to do something

938
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,200
like that it suggests that

939
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,920
people who find that argument convincing

940
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,920
do you think that they were acting but i

941
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,760
want to know what you think you defend

942
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,920
them you vote i'm sorry you vote to to

943
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,680
convict right yeah i don't think that

944
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,320
they acted in a morally appropriate way

945
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,560
and why not what do you say here's

946
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,960
marcus he just defended them

947
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,480
he said

948
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,960
you heard what he said yes that that

949
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,760
yes

950
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,440
that you've got to do what you've got to

951
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,280
do in a case like that

952
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,480
yeah what do you say to marcus

953
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,160
that in

954
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,240
that there's no situation that would

955
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,760
allow human beings to take

956
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:15,599
the idea of fate or the other people's

957
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:17,440
lives in their own hands that we don't

958
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,200
have that kind of

959
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,680
power good okay thank you and what's

960
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:25,520
your name brett brett okay who else

961
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,960
what do you say

962
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,440
stand up i'm wondering if dudley and

963
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,359
steven had asked richard for richard

964
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:33,119
parker's consent

965
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:37,280
in you know dying um if that would

966
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,160
would that exonerate them from

967
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,800
from uh an act of murder and if so is

968
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,440
that still morally justifiable that's

969
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,760
interesting all right consent wait wait

970
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,440
hang on what's your name

971
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,800
kathleen kathleen says suppose they had

972
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,280
what would that scenario look like so

973
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,000
in the story dudley is there pen knife

974
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,160
in hand

975
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,400
but instead of the prayer

976
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,400
or before the prayer

977
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,160
he says

978
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,280
parker

979
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,079
would you mind

980
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,839
we're desperately

981
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:16,320
hungry as marcus empath

982
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,520
empathizes with we're desperately hungry

983
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,359
you're not going to last long anyhow

984
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,839
yeah you can be a martyr would you be a

985
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:25,520
martyr

986
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,119
how about it parker

987
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:31,440
then

988
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,400
then would it be what do you think would

989
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,720
it be morally justified then suppose

990
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:40,839
suppose parker in his semi-stupor says

991
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:42,400
okay

992
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,920
um i don't think it would be morally

993
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,839
justifiable but i'm wondering even then

994
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:48,160
even then it wouldn't be no you don't

995
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,480
think that even with consent

996
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,640
it would be morally justified are there

997
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,160
people who think

998
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,160
uh who want to take up kathleen's

999
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,400
consent idea and who think that that

1000
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,160
would make it morally justified raise

1001
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,160
your hand if it would if you think it

1002
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,400
would

1003
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,359
that's very interesting

1004
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:08,880
why would consent

1005
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,839
make a moral difference

1006
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:16,160
why would it yes well i just think that

1007
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,319
if he was making his own original idea

1008
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:20,880
and it was his idea to start with then

1009
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,400
that would be the only situation in

1010
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,599
which i would

1011
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:25,599
see it being appropriate in any way

1012
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:27,040
because that way you couldn't make the

1013
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,520
argument that he was pressured you know

1014
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,680
it's three to one or whatever the ratio

1015
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,319
was right and um i think that if he was

1016
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:35,920
making a decision to give his life then

1017
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,079
he took on the agency

1018
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:39,839
to sacrifice himself which some people

1019
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:42,880
might see as admirable and other people

1020
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,280
might disagree with that decision

1021
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,800
so if he came up with the idea

1022
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,880
that's the only kind of consent we could

1023
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,400
have confidence in

1024
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,800
morally then it would be okay

1025
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,040
otherwise

1026
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,520
it would be kind of coerced consent

1027
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,280
under the circumstances

1028
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,760
you think

1029
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,200
is there anyone who thinks

1030
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,720
that even the consent of parker

1031
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,119
would not justify

1032
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:15,280
their killing him

1033
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,200
who thinks that

1034
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,440
yes tell us why stand up

1035
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,079
i think that uh parker would be killed

1036
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,760
with the hope that the other crew

1037
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,240
members would be rescued so

1038
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,920
there's no definite reason that he

1039
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,079
should be killed because you don't know

1040
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:30,960
who

1041
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,720
when they're going to get rescued so if

1042
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,160
you kill him it's killing him in vain do

1043
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,839
you keep killing a crew member until

1044
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:37,200
you're rescued and then you're left with

1045
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,640
no one because someone's going to die

1046
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,440
eventually well the moral logic of the

1047
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,000
situation seems to be that

1048
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,520
that they would

1049
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,920
keep on picking off the weakest maybe

1050
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,920
one by one

1051
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,280
until they were

1052
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,520
rescued and in this case luckily they

1053
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,119
were rescued when three at least were

1054
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:57,520
still alive

1055
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,640
now if

1056
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,040
if parker did give his consent

1057
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,640
would it be all right do you think or

1058
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:06,079
not no no it still wouldn't be right and

1059
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:07,760
tell us why it wouldn't be all right

1060
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,240
first of all cannibalism i believe is

1061
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,839
morally incorrect

1062
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,560
so you shouldn't be even human anyway so

1063
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,920
you so cannibalism is morally

1064
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,160
objectionable outside so then even on

1065
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,160
the scenario

1066
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,640
of waiting until someone died still it

1067
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,119
would be objectionable yes to me

1068
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:29,520
personally i feel like um

1069
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,960
it all depends on one's personal morals

1070
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,200
and like we can't sit here and just like

1071
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,040
this is just my opinion and of course

1072
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,960
other people are going to disagree but

1073
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,240
we'll see let's see what their

1074
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,640
disagreements are and then we'll see if

1075
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:45,119
they have reasons that can persuade you

1076
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:47,200
or not let's try that

1077
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,920
all right let's um

1078
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,040
now is there someone

1079
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,200
who can explain those of you who are

1080
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,680
tempted by consent

1081
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,440
can you explain

1082
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,680
why consent makes

1083
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,680
such a moral difference what about the

1084
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,440
lottery idea

1085
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,440
does that count as consent remember at

1086
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,640
the beginning

1087
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,680
dudley proposed a lottery suppose that

1088
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,680
they had agreed

1089
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,000
to a lottery

1090
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,200
then

1091
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,480
how many would then say

1092
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,319
it was all right suppose there were a

1093
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:23,520
lottery

1094
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,119
cabin boy lost

1095
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:26,640
and the rest of the story unfolded then

1096
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,079
how many people would say it was morally

1097
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:30,640
permissible

1098
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,880
so the numbers are rising if we add a

1099
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,040
lottery let's hear from one of you for

1100
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,599
whom the lottery would make a moral

1101
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:41,359
difference

1102
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:43,359
why would it

1103
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:46,000
i think the essential element in my mind

1104
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,680
that makes it a crime is

1105
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,839
the idea that they decided at some point

1106
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:51,599
that their lives were more important

1107
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:53,760
than his and that

1108
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,040
i mean that's kind of the basis for

1109
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,520
really any crime right it's like

1110
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,359
my needs my desires are more important

1111
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,839
than yours and mine take precedence and

1112
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:02,960
if they had done a lottery where

1113
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:05,359
everyone consented that someone should

1114
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:06,160
die

1115
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,440
and it's sort of like they're all

1116
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,720
sacrificing themselves to save the rest

1117
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,800
then it would be all right

1118
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,599
a little grotesque but

1119
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:17,440
but morally permissible

1120
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,560
yes

1121
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,880
and what's your name matt

1122
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:25,040
so matt for you

1123
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:28,079
what bothers you is not the cannibalism

1124
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:31,280
but the lack of due process

1125
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,200
i guess you could say that

1126
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,400
right

1127
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,079
and can someone who agrees with matt

1128
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:40,079
say a little bit more

1129
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:43,440
about why a lottery

1130
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,640
would make it in your view

1131
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:49,599
morally permissible

1132
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:50,480
go ahead

1133
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,480
the way i understood it originally was

1134
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:53,839
that that was the whole issue is that

1135
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:56,000
the cabin boy was never consulted

1136
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,839
about whether or not something was going

1137
00:44:57,839 --> 00:44:59,839
to happen to him even with the original

1138
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:01,760
lottery whether or not he would be a

1139
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,560
part of that it was just decided that he

1140
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:05,920
was the one that was going to die right

1141
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,680
that's what happened in the actual case

1142
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,440
right but if there were a lottery and

1143
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,680
they'd all agreed to the procedure

1144
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,520
you think that would be okay right

1145
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,119
because then everyone knows that there's

1146
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:17,200
going to be a death whereas you know the

1147
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,040
cabin we didn't know that this

1148
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,200
discussion was even happening there was

1149
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,359
no you know forewarning

1150
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:25,280
for him to know that hey i may be the

1151
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,680
one that's dying all right now suppose

1152
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,359
he everyone agrees to the lottery they

1153
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:31,839
have the lottery the cabin boy loses and

1154
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:34,319
he changes his mind

1155
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:35,920
you've already decided it's like a

1156
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,000
verbal contract you can't go back on

1157
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,920
that you've decided the decision was

1158
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:40,800
made

1159
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,160
you know if you know that you're dying

1160
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,319
for the you know the reason for others

1161
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:46,880
to live you would if someone else had

1162
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,720
died you know that you would consume

1163
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,640
them so

1164
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:51,680
that's right

1165
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,079
but but then he could say i know but i

1166
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:56,400
lost

1167
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,000
i just think that that's the whole moral

1168
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,079
issue is that there was no consulting of

1169
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:02,240
the cabin boy and that that's what makes

1170
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,760
it the most

1171
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,839
horrible is that he had no idea what was

1172
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:08,000
even going on that had he known what was

1173
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,400
going on it would

1174
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,240
be a bit more understandable all right

1175
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,800
good now i want to hear so there are

1176
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,800
some who think

1177
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,280
it's morally permissible but only about

1178
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:22,000
twenty percent

1179
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,760
uh

1180
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,319
led by marcus

1181
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:28,640
then there are some who say the real

1182
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,000
problem here

1183
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,480
is the lack of consent

1184
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,480
whether the lack of consent to a lottery

1185
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,800
to a fair procedure

1186
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,319
or

1187
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:40,880
kathleen's idea lack of consent at the

1188
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,720
moment

1189
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,800
of death

1190
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,920
and if we add consent

1191
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:48,800
then

1192
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,680
more people are willing to consider

1193
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:54,400
the sacrifice morally justified

1194
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,960
i want to hear now finally from those of

1195
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,839
you who think even with consent

1196
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:01,520
even with the lottery

1197
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,160
even with a final

1198
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,720
murmur of consent by parker

1199
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:07,680
at the

1200
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,480
very last moment it would still

1201
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,400
be wrong

1202
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,400
and why would it be wrong that's what i

1203
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,720
want to hear yes

1204
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,880
well the whole time i've been leaning

1205
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,880
all towards the categorical moral

1206
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,240
reasoning

1207
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:25,280
and i think that

1208
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,960
there's a possibility i'd be okay with

1209
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,200
the idea of a lottery and then the loser

1210
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,200
taking into their own hands to

1211
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,440
kill themselves

1212
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:34,960
so there wouldn't be you know an act of

1213
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,040
murder but i still think that

1214
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:40,079
even that way it's coerced and also i

1215
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:41,520
don't think that there is any remorse

1216
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,599
like in dudley's diary we were eating

1217
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:45,599
our breakfast it seems as though he's

1218
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:47,440
just sort of like um

1219
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,680
you know the whole idea of not valuing

1220
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,200
someone else's life

1221
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,680
so that makes me

1222
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,200
feel like i have to take the category

1223
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,280
you want to throw the book at him

1224
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,119
when he lacks remorse or a sense of

1225
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:02,079
having done anything wrong right

1226
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:04,839
so all right good other any

1227
00:48:04,839 --> 00:48:08,480
other defenders of like

1228
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,079
who say it's just categorically wrong

1229
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:12,960
with or without consent yes stand up

1230
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,359
why i think undoubtedly where society's

1231
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,960
shape murders murder

1232
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,480
murder is murder and in every way and

1233
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,720
our society looks at murder down down on

1234
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:21,680
it in the same light and i don't think

1235
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,280
it's any different in any case good let

1236
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,200
me ask you a question there were three

1237
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,880
lives at stake

1238
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:30,079
versus one okay

1239
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:32,800
the one the cabin boy he had no family

1240
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,359
he had no dependents these other three

1241
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:37,359
had families back home in england they

1242
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:39,520
had dependents they had wives and

1243
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,119
children

1244
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:42,880
think back to bentham

1245
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,960
bentham says we have to consider the

1246
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:48,079
welfare the utility the happiness of

1247
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:51,040
everybody we have to add it all up

1248
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,800
so it's not just numbers three against

1249
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,319
one

1250
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:58,559
it's also all of those people at home

1251
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:00,640
in fact the london newspaper at the time

1252
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,720
and popular opinion sympathized with

1253
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:03,839
them

1254
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:06,160
dudley and stevens and the paper said if

1255
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,200
they weren't

1256
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,480
motivated by affection and concern for

1257
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:11,839
their loved ones at home and their

1258
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:13,280
dependents surely they wouldn't have

1259
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,880
done this yeah and how is that any

1260
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,800
different from people on the corner

1261
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,240
trying to have with the same desire to

1262
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:19,599
feed their family i don't think it's any

1263
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:21,520
different i think in any case if i'm

1264
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,599
from murdering you to advance my status

1265
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:25,040
that's murder and i think that we should

1266
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:26,559
look at all that all in the same light

1267
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:28,720
instead of criminalizing certain uh

1268
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,440
activities and uh and and making certain

1269
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,680
things seem more violent and savage when

1270
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,680
in the same case it's all the same it's

1271
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,440
all the same act and mentality that goes

1272
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,040
in the murder necessity feeds your

1273
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,720
family so suppose it weren't three

1274
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,800
suppose it were thirty

1275
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,319
three 300

1276
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:47,040
one light to save 300.

1277
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,920
or in wartime 3 000. suppose the stakes

1278
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,079
are even bigger suppose it takes even

1279
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:54,160
better i think it's still the same deal

1280
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,079
do you think bentham is wrong to say the

1281
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:57,760
right thing to do

1282
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:00,559
is to add up the collective happiness

1283
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:02,400
you think he's wrong about that i don't

1284
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,079
think he's wrong but i think murder is

1285
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:05,920
murder in any case well then bentham has

1286
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,000
to be wrong if you're right he's wrong

1287
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,920
okay and he's wrong all right

1288
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,559
thank you well done

1289
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:14,480
all right let's step back from this

1290
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:15,920
discussion

1291
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,240
and

1292
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:19,520
notice

1293
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,599
how many objections have we heard to

1294
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:23,040
what they did

1295
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,839
we heard some defenses of what they did

1296
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:27,839
the defenses had to do with

1297
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:31,920
necessity their dire circumstance and

1298
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,839
implicitly at least the idea that

1299
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:35,760
numbers matter

1300
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,000
and not only numbers matter but the

1301
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,040
wider effects matter their families back

1302
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,040
home their dependents

1303
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,359
parker was an orphan no one would miss

1304
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:47,599
him

1305
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,280
so if you

1306
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,640
add up

1307
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:53,760
if you tried to calculate the balance

1308
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,400
of happiness and suffering

1309
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,480
you might have a case for

1310
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:02,079
saying what they did was the right thing

1311
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,400
then we heard at least three different

1312
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,960
types of objections

1313
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,440
we heard an objection that said

1314
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,839
what they did was categorically wrong

1315
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:17,040
mike here at the end categorically wrong

1316
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,839
murder is murder it's always wrong even

1317
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:20,720
if

1318
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:23,119
it increases the overall happiness

1319
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:25,440
of society

1320
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:28,240
a categorical objection

1321
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,559
but we still need to investigate

1322
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:32,559
why murder

1323
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:35,200
is categorically wrong

1324
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,839
is it because

1325
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,720
even cabin boys have certain fundamental

1326
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,000
rights

1327
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,079
and if that's the reason

1328
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:46,079
where do those rights come from if not

1329
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:49,200
from some idea of the larger welfare or

1330
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:52,880
utility or happiness question number one

1331
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:55,520
others said

1332
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,559
a lottery would make a difference a fair

1333
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:01,920
procedure matt

1334
00:52:02,839 --> 00:52:05,599
said but

1335
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:08,480
and some people were swayed by that

1336
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:10,400
that's not a categorical objection

1337
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,920
exactly

1338
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,280
it's saying

1339
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:16,480
everybody has to be counted as an equal

1340
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,480
even though at the end of the day one

1341
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,480
can be sacrificed

1342
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,960
for the general welfare

1343
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,800
that leaves us with another question to

1344
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:27,200
investigate why does agreement to a

1345
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,440
certain procedure

1346
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,359
even a fair procedure

1347
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:34,480
justify whatever result flows

1348
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:37,680
from the operation of that procedure

1349
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,680
question number two

1350
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:42,160
and question number three

1351
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,800
the basic idea of consent

1352
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:48,240
kathleen got us onto this

1353
00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:52,480
if the cabin boy had agreed himself

1354
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,240
and not under duress

1355
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,800
as was added

1356
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,400
then it would be all right to take his

1357
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:01,119
life to save the rest

1358
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:03,599
and even more people signed on to that

1359
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:04,640
idea

1360
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,400
but that raises

1361
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,640
a third philosophical question what is

1362
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,800
the moral work

1363
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,839
that consent

1364
00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:16,720
does why does an act of consent

1365
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,880
make such a moral difference

1366
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:21,119
that an act that would be wrong taking a

1367
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:23,599
life without consent

1368
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:26,079
is morally permissible

1369
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:29,359
with consent

1370
00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:31,440
to investigate those three questions

1371
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:32,480
we're going to have to read some

1372
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:33,839
philosophers

1373
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:35,520
and starting next time

1374
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,839
we're going to read bentham and john

1375
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:42,440
