   > Webhooks
   >
   > Webhooks are a tool that allows your application to listen for and respond to specific events within CartRover as they happen. Rather than having to reach out and check if an event has occurred, CartRover will reach out and notify your application when it has.
   >
   > Because webhooks originate from CartRover, you will need a publically available URL in order for them to work properly.
   >
   > **Note:** CartRover uses the following IP addresses which you may need to whitelist: 50.18.194.14, 54.241.171.180
