## **I can't even solve easy problems on LeetCode. What should I do?**

Good question. There are numerous ways to answer your question but I will try to write the most succinct answer possible.

From my own experience, I can tell you that solving any problem (easy/medium/hard) is difficult if you are not ready to show the required amount of interest to solve the problem. Sometimes, it is not even our fault when we are unable to show interest and focus on the problem we are attempting to solve. I was going through this phase for a couple of years when I used to try super hard to solve new problems with little or no interest. This wore me out completely and I started doing other things of interest to me. Now, I am bored of everything else and reasonably interested in solving problems once again.

For me, personally, looking at the solution and doing a dry run on paper helps. I have tried real hard with no effect for couple of years to solve problems myself without checking the solution first, but this simply saps my energy, leaving me with no further interest to continue solving. I would suggest that you spend some time trying to figure out what works best for you. Read the solution, try to work the same on paper till you understand every bit of technical detail, then finally spend some time trying to make sense of the problem and the solution itself. Make sure, you have understood the question well at least after solving the problem on paper. Doing this rigorous process in the beginning will pave the way for smooth problem solving later on as you keep solving more problems.

Finally, a little advice you may want to consider if you believe this applies to you- Never solve a medium/tough problem in the beginning no matter how many times you have solved simple problems before. Try to do justice to what you have endeavored to complete by moving from easy to medium to hard, in that order. I have seen that this works for me most of the time.



## **Why is LeetCode so important for a software engineer? Why don’t universities teach us how to solve LeetCode problems?**

You’re making a mistake in your first question.

LeetCode isn’t really important for software engineer in any way. Almost all software engineers never ever face any questions similar to LeetCode at their daily jobs. You are not getting salary increase or promotion for your ability to solve these puzzles.

You can say that LeetCode is important for people looking for a job in this field. New grads, unemployed and so on. That’s also a bit of exaggeration, since LeetCode is not the only site you can use for developing skills related to solving such tasks, and not all companies are asking this kind of questions during interviews.

Why don’t universities teach you to solve these problems? On the one hand - they do. During university years you should learn algorithms, data structures etc., and you should get a grasp of basic concepts of CS. Having this knowledge, for those interview questions which are “good” and don’t require you knowing some very specific tricks which are hard to come up with by yourself - you should actually be able to solve them on your own, or at least to come up with several sub-optimal ideas to prove that your brain is capable of something. I recall how I was discussing one problem with another guy at Google during my internship, and when he got some nice idea I was like “Yep, makes sense, I know this one from competitive programming… But I thought you never did competitive programming, so how did you get it?”. His response was: *It’s not about competitive programming, it is about using common sense*.

On the other hand - at university you probably can’t expect a course focused specifically on tackling such tasks. Honestly, I don’t even know what is the main purpose of university education - but I will assume that they try to teach you things required to be a good software engineer, rather than prepare you for job-hunting. Now check the beginning of my answer - you don’t need LeetCode as a software engineer… So it makes sense to teach you something else instead, right?



## **LeetCode isn't free. Why do people recommend it for practice coding?**

There are plenty of reasons programmers recommend LeetCode to practice coding, even when LeetCode Premium isn’t free (though much of the site’s content can be accessed for free). For example:

- **Plenty of coding questions**: LeetCode has a coding challenge repertoire that extends beyond 1,100 questions, and you only need to solve a few dozen of them to keep your coding skills sharp
- **Relevance to big tech companies**: FAANG companies have been known to use questions similar to those featured in LeetCode before, making it the go-to online judge for preparing for technical interviews
- **Strong community**: LeetCode’s problems have discussion boards within them, where the LeetCode community discusses the different ways of solving the problem in the most efficient way possible. It also has threads about less technical topics, like compensation and job offers
- **Multiple programming language support**: LeetCode gets rid of the programming language barrier by having support for over 18 coding languages, including C, C#, C++, JavaScript, Python, MySQL, and PHP
- **It only becomes better with LeetCode Premium**: LeetCode Premium grants access to even more useful features, such as premium problems and solutions, a built-in debugger, interview simulations with immediate feedback on your performance, and more

While it’s a great online judge platform for practicing your coding skills, LeetCode may not be enough if it’s the only resource you’re using to prepare for technical interviews, not only because you’ll need other important non-technical skills to perform well in interviews, but also because you may lack the data structures & algorithms knowledge necessary to solve many of LeetCode’s problems. That’s why the best way to use LeetCode is alongside other tools. After all, it’s hard to prepare too much when trying to land a job at a company like Google or Facebook.

Here are a few of the tools that could be useful to you:

- [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/): An online portal that acts as a library of all things computer science, with extremely detailed written articles and instructional videos on topics such as data structures & algorithms and systems design
- [Tech Interview Pro](https://www.yoreoyster.com/review/tech-interview-pro/): An interview preparation program with over 150 in-depth video lessons covering DS&A, systems design, and the interview process, as well as Q&A sessions with the course’s founder every two weeks
- [Pramp](https://www.pramp.com/): An interview preparation tool that enables users to take part in mock interviews with other software engineers and receive immediate feedback on their performance

LeetCode is a great resource, but you’ll only get the best out of it if you combine it with other resources that make up for what it lacks. Best of luck.
